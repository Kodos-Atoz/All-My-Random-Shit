# Devotion! A synopsis

## Basics

### What is it?
Devotion is a skill that affects/represents your 'Devotion' to a certain deity.
Different deities provide different bonuses that affect different aspects of RSMC, as well as the world around you.

### Okay, but how do I level it?
One way, and the -only- way when starting out, will be to bury your bones at a special altar, rather than just any old dirt hole in the ground. You'll still receive some prayer XP for burying at a Deity Altar, but a reduced amount, based on the bone you're burying.
Once you get to level 15 Devotion, you get an Amulet of Devotion to go along with your trimmed armor.

Amulet of Devotion is a neck item that, when worn, will automatically bury any bones you pick up, and optionally* scatter any ashes as well. As you level up your Devotion skill, you will actually get bonus XP from the bones that you automatically bury!

Another way to gain XP will be to either wear Deity-aligned armor, or trim your own with a special item, and any mob kills you get while wearing the trimmed or special armor will contribute to your Devotion skill.

Later on, there will be other methods of gaining Devotion experience, utilizing different skills. Note that being able to do this will NOT be level gated.



More items may be added down the line, based on player reception and/or requests.
