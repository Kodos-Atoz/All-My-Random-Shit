Speed: Preferably no more than 400 m/s, but if you can get some decent power efficiency, I'd be willing to budge on this. Getting places fast is nice, after all.

I'll try to separate the following items into sections of items that should be in their own room. I suffer from OCPD, so things have to be 'sorted', if you will.
Amenities:

	Industrial Room:
	1x Extractor
	1x Refinery
	1x Assembler
	1x 3D Printer

	Arrivals Bay:
	1x Short Range Teleporter (Long-Range if you can fit one)

	Bridge and/or Ops:
	2x Cyber Warfare Suite (With one locker for each nearby for storing cartridges)
	1-2x Holotable
	Either of the 2-wide cockpits, preferably the one with the captain's chair for when those are functional
	1x Transponder
		Ready Room: (This would be accessible only via a door that's on the bridge, preventing non-officer crew and guests from accessing it)
		Boardroom Table
		Decorative stuff like plants and such

	Cargo Hold:
	1x Salvager & Disposer (With 1-2 cargo pads immediately adjacent for storing drones/beacons, as well as a wall terminal for naming beacons/configuring drones)
	12x (Minimum) Cargo Pallets
	1x Cargo Teleporter

	Secure Storage:
	4-6x Cargo Pallets behind a lockable door for Secure Storage (Things like Rift Fuel or rare resources)

	Atmospherics:
	4-6x Life Support Systems

	Medbay:
	2x Molecular Assembler

	Computer Core:
	1-2x Data Core Terminal
	6-12x Data Core Expansion Bay (It should be noted that any more than 6 Expansion Bays PER TERMINAL is useless, as each terminal can only handle 2 cartridges by default, with each expansion bay increasing this by 1)
	
	Extra Bits:
	I would -love- to have a Rift Generator, but this is optional, as I know those things are huge.
	Mess Hall using Kitchen, Jukebox, Vending Machine, and 1-2x Boardroom tables for places to sit and eat

	Exterior:
	As many sensors as you can fit without making it look bad/tacky/excessive. Around 12 or so should do =D

	
I would prefer to have separate power grids for easier power management, but if you're not familiar with how to efficiently set up power grids, then one group for everything is fine. I can always adjust this later.

Frontal weapons are optional, however I would like at least an aft turret (Rear) for defense while retreating =D
Just don't forget an ammo loader.

As for exterior aesthetics, I really would like something industrial looking however anything is fine. I would -prefer- a symmetrical ship, as I suffer from OCPD, but if you can make something nice looking that's asymmetrical, that's fine too.
