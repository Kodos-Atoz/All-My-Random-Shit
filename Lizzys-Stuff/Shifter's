We arrived at a party for one of the most richest guy's in the city the strange part it was mostly girls...Ok maybe not so strange for a guy. While I was looking over the spread I over heard him and his buttler talking they where whispering about shifter's. I looked around to see who they where talking about but I dont think evan they knew given that they where looking at all the girls. I sighed when the girl next to me handed me a piece of paper it was folded neatly she got up when I didn't read it right away. The man who was talking to his buttler sat on the other side of me I smiled while slowly on wraping the note under the table. I started to read it the first part didn't make any since told me to kiss her... than it said to kiss her infront of our hosts father to make him mad than a warning but I shook my head and crumpled the paper. The man next to me smiled and started to talk to me I smiled back his buttler brought a case over. "Master Damian I brought these for you." He nodded and opened it up I saw a ring with strange markings he took it out. (Damian)" I wander if this would fit you my dear. May I?" I nodded and held my left hand out. He carefuly sliped the ring on one of my fingers. (Rose)" Is that a family heirloom?" He chuckled. "I suppose it is." I blushed than I started to feel a little light headed I started to faint Damian cought me
