Tied to a horse and running from an amgry dragon wasn't somthing id imagen but here we are five knights and me in the you cant tell but i am tied under this cloak. In the distant i saw a castle it was huge and eerie my kind of castle they wanted to go passed but suddenly a nasty storm came the knights headed for the castle. They got off their horses first than got me down one of the knights banged on the huge doors it opened two where standing their both tall one had blue eyes but both had black hair the other had silver eye's they where both well built."Greetings ate you the owner of this castle?" "We are I'm Damian and this is my brother Sebastian what brings you out here?" The leader stepped up. "We need a place to stay to wait out this storm." The two brother's looked at eachother not saying a word.(Damian)"Of course you may stay."(Sebastian)"Whos that young lady?" "Shes dangerous so i wouldn't go nrar her." I rolled my eye's something tells me their more dangerous. I growled under breath since i couldn't talk. I kept looking into their eye's they looked like mine but more cold and lonely their was something else their but suddenly i felt dizzy and blacked out collapsed on the ground
