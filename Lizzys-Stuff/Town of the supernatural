Well I'm sure you'll have fun oh these goes to the library and the gymnasium." I smiled as we walked to the library first I looked around the room was amazing everything was alive my uncle told me about this town that is a special. "Hey cuz need help?" He smiled Aric's my cuz that's been helping me alot since I been living with his dad. (Alexis)"Sure just making sure the library and gymnasium has all the decoration's."Aric started to help as he gave me a hand he was telling me about this town apparently its had alot of strange things happen.(Alexis)"Great you can add another strange thing..." Aric looked at me I thought he'd laugh he didn't actuly he looked sad the same eye's he had when we where little. All of the sudden the ground started shaking Aric dropped the box and covered me.(Aric)"Stay down!" Whats going on? Is this a earthquake... After a minute it stopped the principal was checking on all the students Aric helped me up.(Principal) "Is everyone alright?" (Students) "Yes!" That was weird... Flashes of images flooded my mind and the room started to spin Aric saw my eye's they where slit and burning red than back to silver blue. He rubbed my back witch snapped me out of it. I slowly took a deep breath.(Alexis)"Thanks... What happened?" Aric shrugged than the principal came and checked on us.(Principal) "Are you both alright?" We nodded. "Alright I'm sending everyone home early we can decorate another time." We looked at eachother than we grabbed our things as we walked out of the school building my uncle was their waiting for us. That was fast.(Alexis)"Hi uncle." He smiled. "Hey are you two okay?" We nodded. (Aric)"Ya where fine but what was that all about?"
