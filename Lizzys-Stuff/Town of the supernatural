Alexis can you help me with these boxes? (Alexis)"Sure whats in them?" "Its the decoration's for the Halloween party, oh right this will be your first one here." I nodded." Well I'm sure you'll have fun oh these goes to the library and the gymnasium." I smiled as we walked to the library first I looked around the room was amazing everything was alive my uncle told me about this town that is a special. "Hey cuz need help?" He smiled Aric's my cuz that's been helping me alot since I been living with his dad. (Alexis)"Sure just making sure the library and gymnasium has all the decoration's."Aric started to help as he gave me a hand he was telling me about this town apparently its had alot of strange things happen.(Alexis)"Great you can add another strange thing..." Aric looked at me I thought he'd laugh he didn't actuly he looked sad the same eye's he had when we where little. All of the sudden the ground started shaking Aric dropped the box and covered me.(Aric)"Stay down!" Whats going on? Is this a earthquake... After a minute it stopped the principal was checking on all the students Aric helped me up.(Principal) "Is everyone alright?" (Students) "Yes!" That was weird... Flashes of images flooded my mind and the room started to spin Aric saw my eye's they where slit and burning red than back to silver blue. He rubbed my back witch snapped me out of it. I slowly took a deep breath.(Alexis)"Thanks... What happened?" Aric shrugged than the principal came and checked on us.(Principal) "Are you both alright?" We nodded. "Alright I'm sending everyone home early we can decorate another time." We looked at eachother than we grabbed our things as we walked out of the school building my uncle was their waiting for us. That was fast.(Alexis)"Hi uncle." He smiled. "Hey are you two okay?" We nodded. (Aric)"Ya where fine but what was that all about?" "sure but where trying to figure it out in the mean time lets get you both home." I got into the car my head was pounding and everything was heightened... Aric looked at me. We started to drive I glanced out the window I a white wolf I he was staring at me with blue eye's something about him made me really relaxed when I blinked he was gone. I rubbed my temples my uncle looked at me in his mirror I smiled faintly trying to show that I'm fine... Not vary convincing we finally pulled up to the house but I felt so weak I couldn't get out of the car I grumbled. My uncle came to my side and opened the door he gave me a smile and carried me into the house.(Alexis)"Thanks uncle I I'm okay now." He laughed than laid me on the couch it was soft and fuzzy that I started to drift off. I was in a deep sleep I was flying  over the town than I heard a voice telling me (Go back it's dangerous hurry!)I bolted off the couch out of breath... Ug wander what time it is... I looked around around both uncle and cousin was gone than I saw a note on a plate.(Alexis we you dinner where off to work be safe.) Is it really that late... Wait than went to work even after that earthquake? Maybe walk will help my head or at least some air will be good. I locked up the house and headed out. As I stepped out into the fresh air I took a deep breath annd let it out slowly I looked up into the sky it was vary clear tonight. Oh ya isn't their that park and it's nearby! That settles it park it is. Wow its a nice walk I bet it would be really nice weather to fly... I got to to the park it was quiet hardly anyone was around except for couples I looked around to find an empty bench I saw one next to the water fountain I sat down and pulled out the dinner uncle made. I was about to unwrap it when I looked up and saw that white wolf from earlier. (Alexis)"Oh it's you from before are you alone?" The wolf nodded. (Wolf) Why are you by your self?" (Alexis)"I can handle myself thank you."The wolf looked at me with his blue eye's almost as blue as the crystal clear ocean. (Alexis)"Are you hungry?" He shook his head. "Least tell me your name?" (Wolf)"Your a strange girl I can't tell you my name but I'll stay with you." I laughed when a sharp pain in head made me cring the white wolf saw me in pain so he jumped onto the seat next to me and rubbed his head on my shoulder the pain vanished without realizing I was running my hand through his fur he didn't seem to mind it I smiled pulled off the cover for my dinner it smelled great uncle was the best at cooking I started to eat uncles chicken with gravy with Carrot's and potatoes. I finished eating and carefully placed everything back. I got up.(Alexis)"I should probably head back..." Than an omanis voice came out from the shadow's. "What's the rush?" A man walked out of the shadow's one looked frozed me in place my hands trembled as he got closer. (Whats wrong?) The man grind at me. Seems only I was able to see him witch terrified me even more. His hands was getting closer than the lights flickered and he was gone.The wolf looked at me with worry. (Wolf)"Why don't I walk you home."I looked at him and nodded I wasn't going to argue there.He walked on the side of me he was alert to his surrounding but he also made sure I was okay a wolf instincts where higher than normal animals but this seemed different it reminded me of my cousin and uncle
