Hey Alexis the villagers are all waiting are you really going to the ruins by yourself? "Yes I really am." "But I heard bad things happen their plus I heard an evil dragon lives their..." "A dragon? Oh I heard of that to... But you know I'm not afraid." "But being trapped in ruins for a week is harsh!" I smiled and hugged my friend. "I'll be fine really besides it's my chance to change thing's around here." The adults where waiting at the gates. To be a guardian dragon for this village. "Are you ready?" I nodded. (Alexis)"I'm ready." "Enter but be warned you may not leave until you've fulfilled a pack or die trying understand." "Yes I understand." The gates opened I stepped through the doors slowly closed behind me I sighed in relief I looked around to a huge structure. Wow amazing! This place is huge. A gust of wind blew through the place felt like an icey wind hitting my scales I shivered but not because of the wind but because I cought scent of another dragon... I lit up the place. Well I better look around geeze the air is different here... Of course just calm down... I looked around slowly making my way around... I walked for what seems like hours I decided to rest against a pillar. While I rested I thought I heard breathing I slowly got up putting out the flame I made. Okay so I'm not alone... I took a deep breath my eyes changed I can see in the dark right in front of me a huge dragon was watching me. (Alexis)"Um hi..." The dragon smiled than stood up the wings spread. "This is rare." The dragon's voice made my heart jump. "What's a hatchling doing here?" A hatchling?? I looked up at the dragon. (Alexis)"I don't know what your talking about but I'm here to become a guardian!" The dragon laughed. "Do you know where you are?" I nodded. "It's my final test right...?" The dragon came closer. "No!" Ouch geeze what's the matter with him... (Alexis) "Who are you and what is this place?" "I am the darkness king! I was sleeping... To answer your other question this place was a temple till I was trapped here..." "Really?" "Yes I can't believe you would come here not knowing what you where stepping into." "The villagers said I could be their guardian if I went in by making a pack..." "Must mean with a guardian... I have a better idea." "What would that be?" He pointed a claw at me. (Dragon)"Make a pack with me instead I can see it your like me." He grind. (Alexis)"Is that possible? " "Hold it get away from that dragon!" Huh? I turned around their where five guy's in a fighting stance. (What will you do little one?) I took a deep breath and looked at the men Their energy was high and already in a fighting mood my power's place a magic barrier in front of me.  (Now we can talk without them...) I sighed  walking back to the big dragon I found a spot to stand. The dragon laughed. (Why do you want to become a guardian?) (Well my village only has no guardian... I'm the only dragon their...) (Oh? What is it that you wish?) (That's a strange question... I suppose I want a purpose and excitement.) The men started to attack the barrier while we talked. (Tell me how can I make a pack and why would a king choose to form one with me?) (Form a pack with me and be mine!) (Okay but I never made a pack with another dragon.) The dragon laughed. (I know you have no scent of another now hurry and make a pack. Its just like forming one with ... A human but for us dragon's its more.) I nodded and kneeled
