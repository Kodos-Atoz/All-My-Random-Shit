Sis said to meet her at her work right? I pulled up to a building and turned off my bike. I walked in to the building and a guard was sitting at a desck. "Scuse me umm I'm here to see my sister." (Security)"Right take the elivater to the top." "Thanks..." I got into the elivater pushing the top button. Leaning up agaisnt the wall was all I could do while I waited. It dinged and the doors opened I walked through to find a huge office... "You must be Alexis Kate told me about you." "Oh yes I am." He laughed. "Sorry didn't mean to startle you I'm her boss." He held out his hand for a handshake I accepted it. (Kate)"Alexis!" Kate came up from behind and wrapped her arm's around me. (Alexis)"Sister... Your choking me..." She chuckled. (Kate)"I missed you" I blushed and smiled. (Alexis)"I missed you to but could you not hug me so tight?" She eased up. (Kate)"I see you met Alex." He smiled. (Boss)"Alex?" I was embaressed.

(Kate)"Did you get what I asked for?" I nodded. (Alexis)"It wasn't easy you know but I did manage to find it." I held out a locket with a blue and red gem in the middle of it. (Aric)"Where did you get that?" (Alexis)"Why do you want to know? I got it for Kate sence she asked me." (Kate)"Actuly I wanted to give it back to it's owner."  (Aric)"Kate I told..." She stopped him. (Alexis)"I'm lost..." (Aric)"That locket belongs to my family but was lost..." I handed it to Kate. (Kate)"How much?" (Alexis)"For you nothing. I Delivered it so the job is done you can do what ever you want with it. Oh I also found that book you wanted." Her eye's lit up. (Aric)"Are you doing anything tonight?" (Alexis)"Nope." (Aric)"Why don't I take you both out for dinner tonight?" (Kate)"Sounds great!" I nodded. (Alexis)"Oh right here's my card if you need anything give me a call any relics or more family keep sake I can get anything for you at the right price." Kate punched my arm... "Ow I was kidding...Besides payment isn't money..." (Aric)"What do you usely trade for than?" "Relics or information or part's for our tech." (Kate)"Sis" I turned as she threw her key's at me. "You can crash at my place though I'm still packing so might be a mess." (Alexis)"Thank's. See you to tonight than." I hugged Kate and left. I put my helmit back on and got on my bike.I turned it on and pulled out than I got an incoming call I tapped my helmit. (Alexis)"Hello?" (Boss)"Alexis how did it go with your sister?" (Alexis)"It went okay though her tight hug's will be the death of me..." (Boss)"Did you tell her where your going?" "Kind of not completely...Tonight where having dinner so I thought I wouldn't tell her everything she already worries about me as it is..." (Boss)"Dinner?"

(Boss)"Your always my concern Alexis wether it's busness or pleasure you know this." I chuckled. (Alexis)"Damien I'm always your's besides I wouldn't worry my sister has her eye's on that man anyway's and I'm pretty sure he has her on his as well." (Damien)"I'll see you this weekend." (Alexis)"See you than..." (Damien)"Zu'u love Hi Dii Dragoness." I smiled and blushed (Alexis)"Zu'u love Hi Wah Dii Dova." I hung up. I hurried to my sister's place. When I got their I parked and got the key's out When I unlocked the door box's almost fell on me... "She wasn't kidding..." I caught most of the box's and placed them aside while closing the door. I took off my helmit and put it away. I went to her bathroom to take a shower I took all my clothes off and turned the water on. I got in the water felt great against my skin I rubbed my shoulders they where really sore... My hair went passed my back my bangs went to my stomach my tail swayed back and forth the markings revealed themselves. The water washed over my horns and pointed ears when I opened my eyes they where slit and red sapphire. I ran my claws through my hair. (Kate)"Sis I'm washing your clothes!" (Alexis)"Thanks! Your home early!" (Kate)"I'm on break there's fresh towels in the cabinet."
