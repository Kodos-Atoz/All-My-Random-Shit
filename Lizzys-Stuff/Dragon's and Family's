Sis said to meet her at her work right? I pulled up to a building and turned off my bike. I walked in to the building and a guard was sitting at a desck. "Scuse me umm I'm here to see my sister." (Security)"Right take the elivater to the top." "Thanks..." I got into the elivater pushing the top button. Leaning up agaisnt the wall was all I could do while I waited. It dinged and the doors opened I walked through to find a huge office... "You must be Alexis Kate told me about you." "Oh yes I am." He laughed. "Sorry didn't mean to startle you I'm her boss." He held out his hand for a handshake I accepted it. (Kate)"Alexis!" Kate came up from behind and wrapped her arm's around me. (Alexis)"Sister... Your choking me..." She chuckled. (Kate)"I missed you" I blushed and smiled. (Alexis)"I missed you to but could you not hug me so tight?" She eased up. (Kate)"I see you met Alex." He smiled. (Boss)"Alex?" I was embaressed. (Kate)"Yup I used to call her that alot.Alexis this is my boss Aric. Alexis..." Kate looked at me with a pouty look. (Alexis)"Yes?" (Kate)"Please tell me your staying this time..." She glared at me. (Alexis)"Yes till this weekend any way's..." (Kate)"Well at least I get to see you some." (Aric)"What is it that you do if you don't mind telling?" (Alexis)"I travel around searching for artifacts and legends this time it's in the ocean. We'll be testing out new deep sea diving gear while searching for a lost temple..." (Kate)"Did you get what I asked for?" I nodded. (Alexis)"It wasn't easy you know but I did manage to find it." I held out a locket with a blue and red gem in the middle of it. (Aric)"Where did you get that?" (Alexis)"Why do you want to know? I got it for Kate sence she asked me." (Kate)"Actuly I wanted to give it back to it's owner."  (Aric)"Kate I told..." She stopped him. (Alexis)"I'm lost..." (Aric)"That locket belongs to my family but was lost..." I handed it to Kate. (Kate)"How much?" (Alexis)"For you nothing. I Delivered it so the job is done you can do what ever you want with it. Oh I also found that book you wanted." Her eye's lit up. (Aric)"Are you doing anything tonight?" (Alexis)"Nope." (Aric)"Why don't I take you both out for dinner tonight?" (Kate)"Sounds great!" I nodded.
