Sirens and people panicking my world turned upsidedown for saving someone... My friend was crying as the ambulance took me away. I was a student on my way to school with my best friend... My friend rushed to the hospital. "Please can I see her!" "Miss I'm sorry but if your not family..." "But her dad's away right now!" "Scuse me there was a girl that was brought in can I see her?" "Are you her dad?" He shook his head. "Than I'm sorry but..." The nurse gazed into the man's eye's and started blushing."I'm sure this young lady would want to see her friend would it be alright to just make sure she's okay?" The nurse nodded. "Really? Wich room?" The nurse gave them directions. "Your that man Alexis saved aren't you?" "Yes I wanted to thank her... I hope she's alright..." "Alexis is really tuff her dad's friend owns a dojo so she's been staying their." "And her dad?" "He's out of town on a trip..." "Forgive for prying..." They got to my room and knocked. "Come in..." I said faintly... They entered crystal started crying. (Alexis)"Why the water works?" (Crystal) "Idiot! You jumped out and got hit..." I smiled painfully. I looked at the man behind crystal he was tall pale skin with black hair. His clothes looked expensive but his Aurora was different... He bowed his head. "I wanted to thank you for saving my life..." (Alexis)"I'm just glad your alright...Crystal I'm fine just a phew broken ribs and arm...The doc said I shouldn't pick up a sword till it's healed.
