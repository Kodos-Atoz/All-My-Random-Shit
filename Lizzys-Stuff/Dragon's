I was breathing hard as I had just woken up finding my self in a middle of a battle a man tried to tame me but was interrupted. Now I'm on the run for my life from all these fellow dragons... I hid behind a metal door when suddenly a masive green dragon came in I lowered to the ground when that man was riding it. I couldn't tell wether to be terrified or... The man spotted me and smiled he didn't attack me though. What Doe's this human want...? He got off the green dragon and headed the other way. Huh? What's he doing? He signalled at me to come to him. I did slowly other dragons showed up I growled but they didn't flinch...so I kept walking till I stopped near the human he was casting a weird spell it made me calm I lowered my self to the ground he came around and got on my back at first it was strange but he wanted me to fly... I stood up spreading my wing's I lifted us off the ground. I was starting to get the hang of someone on my back. As we where flying we passed a valley, I heard a dragon behind me... I looked around the human looked different from the one riding me. I got the feeling he wanted me to attack. I released fire from my jaw. Another dragon attacked from the side knocking me to the ground I growled and fought back but something wrapped around me... "Easy where not here to hurt you. We better take this one back..." A huge black dragon grabbed me and flew off. "Forgive me sire we almost lost some of the dragon's... Luckily we still have this one." I started to fade. When I woke I was laying in some kind of grass... Where am I? A human clad in armor appeared. "Look's like this one's awake." "It looks kinda small you sure it can fight?" "The dragon master wants any dragon. It's not our place to question plus this one's strangely eager to fight." "Alright let's take it to the arena..." I followed the humans to a larg area with more humans making alot of noise... The humans who brought me here closed a large gate. I growled when a huge dragon appeared... Your kidding... It's not the one who picked me up but... It's tail swung at me I quickly dodged but it kept attacking... Why are you attacking me!? It knocked me against the ground it's claws was digging into my side's I could hear the humans. "It's weak!" "Rip it apart!" I'm going to die!? Bigger I need to be bigger!... My body felt strange suddenly I felt something over take me. I let out a deathly roar my scales changed and marking's started to appear. I wasn't bigger but the other dragon backed off. A circle appeared in front of me my mouth was in flame's but black flame's. As I was about to blow away the dragon that human appeared and I felt calm again... I felt like I was in a daze the next thing I was back in that room... I lowered my head.... "Ah my lord what brings you down here?" "That dragon where did you get it?" "In the wild near the ruin's. She maybe small but she's not like any dragon I've come acrossed." "Ah the one the king had to grab?" "Yes regrettably those Knight's where being a pest again." It's... Night time. My body was black as night my eye's changed black mist swirled around me I vanished into the night. "Where's that dragon?" "Oh my this isn't good..." I sored through the night hungry so I hunted...
