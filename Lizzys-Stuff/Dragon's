I was breathing hard as I had just woken up finding my self in a middle of a battle a man tried to tame me but was interrupted. Now I'm on the run for my life from all these fellow dragons... I hid behind a metal door when suddenly a masive green dragon came in I lowered to the ground when that man was riding it. I couldn't tell wether to be terrified or... The man spotted me and smiled he didn't attack me though. What Doe's this human want...? He got off the green dragon and headed the other way. Huh? What's he doing? He signalled at me to come to him. I did slowly other dragons showed up I growled but they didn't flinch...so I kept walking till I stopped near the human he was casting a weird spell it made me calm I lowered my self to the ground he came around and got on my back at first it was strange but he wanted me to fly... I stood up spreading my wing's I lifted us off the ground. I was starting to get the hang of someone on my back. As we where flying we passed a valley, I heard a dragon behind me... I looked around the human looked different from the one riding me. I got the feeling he wanted me to attack. I released fire from my jaw. Another dragon attacked from the side knocking me to the ground I growled and fought back but something wrapped around me... "Easy where not here to hurt you. We better take this one back..." A huge black dragon grabbed me and flew off. "Forgive me sire we almost lost some of the dragon's... Luckily we still have this one." I started to fade. When I woke I was laying in some kind of grass... Where am I? A human clad in armor appeared. "Look's like this one's awake." "It looks kinda small you sure it can fight?" "The dragon master wants any dragon. It's not our place to question plus this one's strangely eager to fight." "Alright let's take it to the arena..." I followed the humans to a larg area with more humans making alot of noise... The humans who brought me here closed a large gate. I growled when a huge dragon appeared... Your kidding... It's not the one who picked me up but... It's tail swung at me I quickly dodged but it kept attacking... Why are you attacking me!? It knocked me against the ground it's claws was digging into my side's I could hear the humans. "It's weak!" "Rip it apart!" I'm going to die!? Bigger I need to be bigger!... My body felt strange suddenly I felt something over take me. I let out a deathly roar my scales changed and marking's started to appear. I wasn't bigger but the other dragon backed off. A circle appeared in front of me my mouth was in flame's but black flame's. As I was about to blow away the dragon that human appeared and I felt calm again... I felt like I was in a daze the next thing I was back in that room... I lowered my head.... "Ah my lord what brings you down here?" "That dragon where did you get it?" "In the wild near the ruin's. She maybe small but she's not like any dragon I've come acrossed." "Ah the one the king had to grab?" "Yes regrettably those Knight's where being a pest again." It's... Night time. My body was black as night my eye's changed black mist swirled around me I vanished into the night. "Where's that dragon?" "Oh my this isn't good..." I sored through the night hungry so I hunted... A village? I change to human form and collapsed near a hutt. "Who's their? Oh my what happened?" My stomac growled. the human helped me inside and fed me...The food didn't taste right... "Well boss looks like you cuaght a good looker." I growled...and stood up. "Big mistake humans...I'm still starving." My eye's slit my claw's where razer sharp I clawed the one man near the door the rest ran I changed to my dragon form and feasted. I killed the other's exept one got away while I was busy. "So this is where you went." The man from earlier appeared. "Oh right you where asleep you must of been starving. Bandits huh? "Help..me..." One was barely alive. The man crouched and smiled but it wasn't a friendly smile. "Hurry up and finish your meal than where heading back." I opened my jaw with razer sharp fang's I ate it in one bite and burned the rest. The man got on my back once more and I flew off. When we got their they  washed the blood off of me and put me back into that room. The next morning they had dragon's line up in the arena I was last in line. A bigger dragon appeared with a human riding...the other's where afraid.The energy it was giving off was huge but it wasn't him I was worried about it was the one on his back. The man calmed everyone down. "Sire these are the dragon's we where able to snag." What's wrong with them...The ground started to shake and crumble beneath me. I changed to my half human form. "This boring..." I chanted as armor wrapped around me.But than my stomac growled...My armor shattered. Ug to hungry...I flew out of the arena. "Sire I'll bring her back..." (Dark king)"No need." The king's dragon flew off after me. I landed near that village. "Hey it's that monster that killed our men!" "You sure? It looks like a girl." "Does a girl have horns and tail?" "Don't forget wing's." He nodded than looked up. When the King arrived the village was silent and I was in the middle covered in blood. I turned around I dropped the human that was in my claw's and smiled. The mark's appeared all over my body I sensed danger fro, behind me an arrow of light was headed for me but I grabbed it dragging me back a bit... "It's no use! Dragon!" The black dragon laughed. "If you can fight this hunter you can have all the meat you want." "Huh really? Alright! Wait... If I can?" The man appeared in white and gold armor. "Give up dragon that arrow can pierce anything." Well true this thing sting's but... I shattered it right before his eye's. "It's just magic...Hmm In this form I think I can manage 10%..." I started chanting the skies grew dark I raised a hand to the skies as a huge circle appeared. "Guase this will do..." I pointed my other hand towards the human as energy built up in it and lightning struck the circle above me. when it was finished I lowered my hand. I breathed in deep than clasped my hands togeather the circles merged and massive energy burst forth leveling the village in its path was the man bracing himself. At the last moment someone teleported in and saved the man by teleporting out...Well the towns gone..."Human's! that's cheating....Their goes my food..." I started to black out... Not good... The dragon snached me. When they returned the king placed me into a cage. I woke up but everything was dark... Ug where am I? "Your in the catacomb's my master has chosen you." "For what?" "To be apart of his army that's all I'm telling you." No cage can hold me... I chanted and held my hand out but all of a sudden I felt weak... "You won't be able to cast magic that cage is designed to hold mages." I mumbled... Than I heard someone coming. "Sire what will you do with this one?" (Dark King)"She's usefull. Train her to be obedient." I looked as two men appeared... "Strange though she's been vary obedient exept when it comes to hunger." It's not my fualt I been asleep for who know's how long..." I bet if you feed her Master she'll work." (Dark king)"Fine than you'll train her."I phased through the cage. "Really?" (Dark King)" But only if you obay and work." I nodded as my mouth watered. Than I changed back to my dragon form. The dragon and I trained all day.
