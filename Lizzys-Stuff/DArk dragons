The forests was peaceful the elves and the fearies got along well. I went to my varoreit spot in the forest where a huge tree stood tall in the middle of meadow I would always lay below. I am a dragon the forest took me in when I was but a hatchling. I touch the tree with my forhead... my long silver hair went down to my ankles  my tail barely laid across the grass the young fearies would often play with my horns or pull on my ears...My ears drooped down. Isn't it quiet...To quiet. I closed my eye's I could see through the forests. I opened my eye's. Where are all the fearies and the creatures of the forests? The tree was afraid of something out their... The skies grew dark...than I heard howls echo throughout the forests...the trees roots closed the entrance of this place. (tree spirit)"You must flee from here." "What are you saying? Your trembling... I won't leave you." The howls where getting closer... Some how the wolves gotten through... "What are those?" They attacked but I held them off until they backed off someone was coming...A man clad in black armor behind him was a creature in black robes. "What are you waiting for distroy the tree!" I stood infront of her to protect her but one swipe of the mans sword and I crashed behind the tree..."Stop your hurting her!"They didn't listen... It's as if they couldn't see me... All I could hear was her screams tears ran down my cheeks I felt helpless...than I couldn't hear her any more. "Whats this? We missed one..." (Run...) I heard her last words and spread my wings I flew above them..
