7/16/2016  Dream of a battle         


My team and others where camping out 
before the big battle when one of the creatures entered our camp I 
told my companions not to make any sound or move and let it pass, 
cause if theirs one than there are others not far of coarse the 
other teams saw it and panicked I had only moments to protect my 
team from its assault when it fled another one charged at the 
solder to my front in a split second I took it down than two others
 shot it as it fell. We scrambled to gather our things and rushed 
off to battle for an army was close by  I commanded my team into 
battle as I pulled a sword from my belt flames surrounded it, as I 
charged I saw a whirlpool of water coming from part of the 
battlefield as I entered I was trapped by the leader of these 
creatures the creature circled me I warned it to prepare that I 
wasn't human of coarse the creature knew this and gloated  taking 
a bite in my side I grit my fangs I smiled whispering words from a 
different tongue markings appeared the creature let go and a huge 
dragon big as a mountain appeared from below the creature gave off 
one last cry before the dragon engulfed it whole. As the dragon 
flew off the Battle was over and my comrades came to my aid I 
sighed in relief holding my side they where amazed at what 
happened I told them that I was able to summon the dragon they 
where amazed like children often where at finding something new my 
commander told me to take it easy. My team helped me down to sit 
against a rock I lifted my shirt part ways to see how bad the 
creature got me. Letting the creature bite me was probably 
unthinkable but it was worth it.
