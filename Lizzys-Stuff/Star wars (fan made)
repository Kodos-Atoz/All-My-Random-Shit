Alexis come on we got to get back to taking supplies to the medical than don't forget we got to help that jedi...Alexis are you even listening? (Alexis)"Yes I'm...(I yawn) listening I'm just waking up that's all..." "I bet you where practising again whernt you?" I smiled and nodded. "Are you you shouldn't tell the jedi here I mean know your good don't you think its dangerous that you know so much without any training?" I glared at him."You know what I mean you even make your own collection of sabers..." I covered his mouth and told him to hush. Than we heard explosions the alarm sounded we rushed to our stations on our we ran into the jedi fighting a sith. While they fought the sith grind than the jedi master force pushed him passed one of the heavy doors without thinking I started to close then with the force the jedi helped before it closed completly the sith threw his saber I stopped it in mid air i looked at him and started spinning it than throwing it back at him of coarse he jumped over it i rolled my eye's as the doors finally closed i was out of breath the jedi helped me stand. "We should get moving that wont hold him for long than will talk." We nodded and ran. (Alexis)"You two keep going i'll catch up!" I went on a different path leading to my room i was shuffling to grab the light sabers i made solders opened my door without looking i lifted my sabers into the air and threw them with the force knocking them out of my room. I left the room only find the sith waiting. "Thats quite the skills to handle so many..." I smiled spinneing all of them than throwing them at him.(Alexis)"I thought you wanted that jedi?" "Whats taking so long..?" A man was behind me terrior shot through me and excitement i brought my sabers back than started to spin them really fast but i felt a sharp pain in my chest than i blacked out my sabers stopped and fell to the ground than I collapsed. "Let's go we have a jedi to capture." They left. My wound started to heal my eye's where red and slit like a beast's. "Ouch...Time to go..." I got up picking up my sabors. I snuck to one of the room's to get changed than headed to the escape pods... When I got to them most of the pods where missing or damaged...I kicked one of the pods than ran off to find another way off the ship that was about to explode... Along the way I ran into some solder's  I grind and swiftly took them down. I got to the controls what I found was that man from earlier... I slowly stepped back when the other sith came up from behind me. "Whern't you dead?" I shrugged than attacked. All of a sudden whispers entered my mind than sharp pain the other sith stabbed me with his saberwhen he pulled it out my wounds already started to heal... (Alexis)" That hurt's!" The escape ship left and I could sence my friend and the Jedi where on it while I was destracted I started to get get dizzy... Ug I need energy...My eye's where red I started to feed from the fallen solder's my eye's where turning blue as I was feeding from the light. than dark energy swirled around me... The energy's where from the two sith...I droped to my knees cluching my arms my eye's went back to red dropping my saber's. I shook my head and stood up. I sighed... "I really don't have time to fight...Since my companion's already left and this ship is about to explode..." Their was a loud explosion I made my escape from the two sith... Phew that was close... I looked for a ship to fly away in I found a star fighter... Perfect! When I climbed on the ship exploded knocking me back and unconsius. The two sith found me laying their they could see the light energy trying to heal me but they stepped in and the darkside over powered it. "Bring her with us." The Master sith signiled the solder's they quickly picked me up and brought me to their ship. They took off as the ship exploded. The energy from the explotion flowed into me like a raging Bantha...I woke up my eye's where red and slit but I couldn't move...I looked around I saw the Master sith meditating and the younger sith flying the ship. I started to hear whisperes in my mind.
