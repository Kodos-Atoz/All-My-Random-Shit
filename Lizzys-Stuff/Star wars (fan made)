Alexis come on we got to get back to taking supplies to the medical than don't forget we got to help that jedi...Alexis are you even listening? (Alexis)"Yes I'm...(I yawn) listening I'm just waking up that's all..." "I bet you where practising again whernt you?" I smiled and nodded. "Are you you shouldn't tell the jedi here I mean know your good don't you think its dangerous that you know so much without any training?" I glared at him."You know what I mean you even make your own collection of sabers..." I covered his mouth and told him to hush. Than we heard explosions the alarm sounded we rushed to our stations on our we ran into the jedi fighting a sith. While they fought the sith grind than the jedi master force pushed him passed one of the heavy doors without thinking I started to close then with the force the jedi helped before it closed completly the sith threw his saber I stopped it in mid air i looked at him and started spinning it than throwing it back at him of coarse he jumped over it i rolled my eye's as the doors finally closed i was out of breath the jedi helped me stand. "We should get moving that wont hold him for long than will talk." We nodded and ran. (Alexis)"You two keep going i'll catch up!" I went on a different path leading to my room i was shuffling to grab the light sabers i made solders opened my door without looking i lifted my sabers into the air and threw them with the force knocking them out of my room. I left the room only find the sith waiting. "Thats quite the skills to handle so many..." I smiled spinneing all of them than throwing them at him.(Alexis)"I thought you wanted that jedi?" "Whats taking so long..?" A man was behind me terrior shot through me and excitement i brought my sabers back than started to spin them really fast but i felt a sharp pain in my chest than i blacked out my sabers stopped and fell to the ground than I collapsed. "Let's go we have a jedi to capture." They left. My wound started to heal my eye's where red and slit like a beast's. "Ouch...Time to go..." I got up picking up my sabors. I snuck to one of the room's to get changed than headed to the escape pods... When I got to them most of the pods where missing or damaged...I kicked one of the pods than ran off to find another way off the ship that was about to explode... Along the way I ran into some solder's  I grind and swiftly took them down. I got to the controls what I found was that man from earlier... I slowly stepped back when the other sith came up from behind me. "Whern't you dead?" I shrugged than attacked. All of a sudden whispers entered my mind than sharp pain the other sith stabbed me with his saber when he pulled it out my wounds already started to heal... (Alexis)" That hurt's!" The escape ship left and I could sence my friend and the Jedi where on it while I was destracted I started to get get dizzy... Ug I need energy...My eye's where red I started to feed from the fallen solder's my eye's where turning blue as I was feeding from the light. than dark energy swirled around me... The energy's where from the two sith...I droped to my knees cluching my arms my eye's went back to red dropping my saber's. I shook my head and stood up. I sighed... "I really don't have time to fight...Since my companion's already left and this ship is about to explode..." Their was a loud explosion I made my escape from the two sith... Phew that was close... I looked for a ship to fly away in I found a star fighter... Perfect! When I climbed on the ship exploded knocking me back and unconsius. The Jedi and my friend found me and brought me onboard one of an empty ship. I was sweeting and thrashing about in my sleep tormented by the darkness the jedi spent the whole time trying to keep back the dark energy's till they got to an enclave... I woke up to someone checking up on me a woman... "Your awake. I was afraid you wouldn't wake up." The woman smiled placeing a cold cloth over my head. "Please don'y move for awhile you had a violent fever..." (Alexis)"Where am I?" I said faintly trying to get my bareings the woman looked at me than someone came in speaking I recongnized their voice. (Jedi)" How are you feeling?" (Alexis)"I feel like I just got ran over by a bantha..." The jedi laughed than told the woman to leave us, she bowed and left. "Tell me what happened? And don't hold back..." I sighed and got comfertable. (Alexis)"I ran to find a way off the ship... I ran into those sith at first it was just one so I thought I could sneak away but the another was waiting..." The jedi stopped me. (Jedi)"I know that's not all I felt your present vanish if only a moment... I'm sure that Master sith also felt it." I nodded. "I was fighting that one sith at first but I was caught off guard and..." I cringed rubbing my chest. "I can quickly heal any wounds I guase when that ediot pierced my chest again they forced dark energy instead... That was more painful than that explosion." "That abillity of your's is a double edge blade when you where fighting I could feel a hint of darkside inside but when I felt your life fainting I felt the Lightside come to your aid. It's not everyday you come into contact with such a gift but be werry." I nodded with a sigh. "Get some rest will talk later about this." He patted my shoulder and started walking out. "Are you sure she should be here?" The jedi nodded and asked not to talk about it at this time. After awhile of resting I started to get restless I took a deep breath and stinguished my energy though it took its toll...I snuck out of the room looking around I found my self in a small field. We've landed on a small enclave  but the planet was wasn't much abandond I'v never seen such a planet nore the energy here... their was a mixture normaly you wouldn't be able to tell but I could it was like a whisper. Maybe a walk will do me some good. I started to walk the fields not realizing how far I walked from the enclave infact I came to what looked like ruins it looked defferent than the jedi enclave I was at.The whisper's got louder something was drawing me near... I walked near the entrance the door's opened I hestated for a moment but the pull was stronger I entered... I kept walking as the doors closed the air was cold and hot at the same time I came to another door their was a present beyond the door before I could step away the door opened my thoughts where washed away by the whispers I looked around when my eye's caught a figure in the middle of the chamber. I couldn't speak."Why does a child seak answer's?" His voice sent chills down my spine it echoed in my ears... "Does it really pain you to keep away the darkside?" My heart skipped a beat... How does he know... "You cannot mask your presents from me little one." I blinked he vanished I looked around despretly I walked up to the place the man was. Or was he a man... Keep calm this isn't like you... "Do you believe that Jedi wants to help you? Didn't he decieve you on that ship?" (Alexis)" I...but I..." A wave of dark energy swept over me it was to much I blacked out. I dreamed of the past when I first discovered my power's I was alone in a village that was abandoned by the war's of the jedi's and sith raders often came by to see if any finds would show up from the storms. My first I was caugh up in one of the raiders raids beatin near death they laughed but I started to heal I stood up the raider's shocked look and fear as blades swirled around me in a swift action they fell. I woke up in a sweat my eye's where red and slit.
