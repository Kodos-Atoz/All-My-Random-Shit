Alexis come on we got to get back to taking supplies to the medical than don't forget we got to help that jedi...Alexis are you even listening? (Alexis)"Yes I'm...(I yawn) listening I'm just waking up that's all..." "I bet you where practising again whernt you?" I smiled and nodded. "Are you you shouldn't tell the jedi here I mean know your good don't you think its dangerous that you know so much without any training?" I glared at him."You know what I mean you even make your own collection of sabers..." I covered his mouth and told him to hush. Than we heard explosions the alarm sounded we rushed to our stations on our we ran into the jedi fighting a sith. While they fought the sith grind than the jedi master force pushed him passed one of the heavy doors without thinking I started to close then with the force the jedi helped before it closed completly the sith threw his saber I stopped it in mid air i looked at him and started spinning it than throwing it back at him of coatse he jumped over it i rolled my eye's as the doors finally closed i was out of breath the jedi helped me stand. "We should get moving that wont hold him for long than will talk." We nodded and ran. (Alexis)"You two keep going i'll catch up!" I went on a different path leading to my room i was shuffling to grab the light sabers i made solders opened my door without looking i lifted my sabers into the air and threw them with the force knocking them out of my room. I left the room only find the sith waiting. "Thats quite the skills to handle so many..." I smiled spinneing all of them than throwing them at him.(Alexis)"I thought you wanted that jedi?" "Whats taking so long..?" A man was behind me terrior shot through me and excitement i brought my sabers back than started to spin them really fast but i felt a sharp pain in my chest than i blacked out my sabers stopped and fell to the ground
