My name is Raven and im on my way to the city to go to college my grandfather and his family invited me to stay with them while I get settled. My uncle waited for me at the train stop. (Raven)"Hi uncle!" "Raven you made it! Im glad let me take your bag's." "Thank you uncle... Whats wrong uncle?" He looked at me. My family is a clan of priest's and priestesses my mother was suppose to take over but...she and my father vanished. "It's not my place to tell you but your grandfather will. Let's get you home and settled in." I nodded knowing uncle he's got alot on his mind... Uncle walked us to his car it was a black nice car. I got in while uncle put my bag's away into the trunk. Uncle got in and started driving. We where driving awhile till we where crossing a bridge the view was beautiful but something changed all the creature's are restless... "So you notice as well?" "What's going on uncle?" "We don't know... You remember our family keeps the balance of light and darkness?" I nodded. "It seems the balance is shifting...And with the king of the dark creatures their fighting over territory and dragging everything and everyone in their path..." "You want me to be the next guardian?" Uncle looked at me. "Don't be so surprised uncle your an open book... Besides I knew I wouldn't have a normal life. " I smiled. "You're just like your mother."
