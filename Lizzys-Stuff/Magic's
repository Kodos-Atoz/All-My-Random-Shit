Wood plank's and knight's started to come crashing down upon us, we ducked. "Howed they find us?" My eye's glowed white for a second..."They have a sorcerer with them...! I grabbed my friend and jumped off the bridge into rushing water's. We got pushed around and drifted to shore I changed us to cat's when we got out we where soaked and tired. I grabbed my friends neck and dragged them to a nearby bush he was out cold...I snuck a peak at the bridge and it was swarmed with black knight's... Where not safe yet...I hid Aric the best I could and looked around. I wandered to a clearing I looked to make sure no one was around witch didn't look like their was So I changed back to human form. All of a sudden I couldn't move someone came up from behind me and covered my eye's with their hand I could hear them chant everything went dark. "My Lord we have the sorcerer who was with the prince but the prince was no where to be found." They chained me up in a tent.
