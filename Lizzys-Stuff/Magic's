Wood plank's and knight's started to come crashing down upon us, we ducked. "Howed they find us?" My eye's glowed white for a second..."They have a sorcerer with them...! I grabbed my friend and jumped off the bridge into rushing water's. We got pushed around and drifted to shore I changed us to cat's when we got out we where soaked and tired. I grabbed my friends neck and dragged them to a nearby bush he was out cold...I snuck a peak at the bridge and it was swarmed with black knight's... Where not safe yet...I hid Aric the best I could and looked around. I wandered to a clearing I looked to make sure no one was around witch didn't look like their was So I changed back to human form. All of a sudden I couldn't move someone came up from behind me and covered my eye's with their hand I could hear them chant everything went dark. "My Lord we have the sorcerer who was with the prince but the prince was no where to be found." They chained me up in a tent. I woke up to faint chatter.Two men came into the tent...One was the mage and the other was a man in black armor...He clasped my chin looking straight into my eye's. "Where's the prince?" I smiled. "What make's you think I'd tell you...." The man in armor took out a black gem it was floating in his hand with black energy. He held it near my chest I could feel the dark energy. "This gem  is rare one of it's kind It bind's to the one who made it well I don't have to tell you I'll let you find out." He held it closer and it went inside me I screamed in pain as I felt it enter. I can hear him whisper in my head my eye's slit like a reptiles where red with black energy my form was changing I grew wing's a tail and horn's and claw's..."I...Won't let it...Be this way...Oh sacred white light...Bring those forth the path to one place to another." A light showed up in two places one where the prince was and another surrounding me the prince ended up back at the castle while I drifted in a dark world.
