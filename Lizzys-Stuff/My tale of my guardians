"(Alexis)" You know I can't leave them be..." "Hey what are you two talking about?" (Alexis)"We where talking about the new principal."

"Right thank you as you all are aware one of the class room is off limits until everything is fixed also I'll be taking over for our leader till he gets back so if anyone needs help or spots something strange please report it to me or one of the other guardians that's all.Now to introduce our new principal and teacher." They stood in front of me."My name is Alexander and I look forward to being your principal and this is Damian he'll be teaching gym class I look forward to getting to know everyone thank you for your time dismissed."Everyone went to their classes.Classes where the same except gym our new teacher was well built but about him made my skin crawl.We stretched before running after running I took up my Katana I practiced till it was lunch time after getting a shower I headed to my favorite spot to eat, some how the principal found me.(Alexander)"Alexis right?"I nodded."Forgive me for interrupting but your friend said I could find you here."Figured as much though why can't I read this man's mind...(Alexis)"What can I do for you?"Alexander gave me a soft smile.(Alexander)"To be straight I wanted to ask you about the guardians here you see I'm still learning everything about this school..."I looked at him.(Alexis)"We mostly protect the students and this school and the students come to us or the council for help we also work for and the teachers to make sure everything goes well we also patrol at night.If you need anything let me know...Also you can find me here or at the library."(Alexander)"Later after could you stop by my office to talk some more?""Sure."I stood up when I did the wind blew I caught several scent I signed. (Alexis)"I better get to work before class starts."Alexander looked at me and bowed my eye's flashed a glance at him not that I ment to he seems so familiar...why? The sky got dark when I was out of his sight I vanished I grabbed my sword and flew up to the skies I fought none stop the world felt like it was so distant they swarmed in one fell swoop I distoyed them all I was breathing hard.I flew to the only person I could think of Jake I staggered towards him.(Jake)"Alexis you look terrible!"I smirked than falling into his arm's."Your pushing yourself again come on let's take you to the nurse's office."I cracked a smile.(Alexis)"I'll be fine its time for classes.Jake sighed but he knew he wouldn't win.(Jake)"Alright let's go..."We got to class I was able to get through the rest of the day without falling asleep.Oh right didn't the principal wanted to see me...I took a deep breath and waited for class to be dismissed. Afterwards I went to the principal's office I knocked.(Alexander)"Come in."I opened the door and walked in Alexander was sitting at his desk he was going through some boxes he glanced at me I may not be able to read his mind but his has looked at me with concern.(Alexis)"You wanted to see me?"He nodded but he didn't say a thing my mind was hazy and everything started to spin.(Alexander)"Are you alright? You look a little pale."Pale that's the last thing I wanted to hear maybe Jake was right it...Everything went black as I passed out Alexander caught me with swift speed.He carried me to one of the couches. When I came to I was in the nurse's office and Jake was talking to the doctor they realised I was awake.(Doc)"How are you feeling?"(Alexis)"Like i been hit by a train... Though i don't feel tired any more."
