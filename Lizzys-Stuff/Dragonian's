A friend of mine invited me to a Christmas party. Claire and I was dancing. This was a small town so everyone knew just about everyone. "Hey Claire did you hear theirs someone moving in that manor." (Claire)"I heard. Who would move their?" "No clue." Claire and I went outside. Claire whispered. (Claire)"I had a dream again..." Claire's family is a clan of people who is a shape shifter. This town maybe small but it hides alot. I lived here since I was a baby Claire's family took care of me. "We should go home maybe your mom would know." We headed to the road. No one was around or so we thought. "Girls shouldn't be out along." We turned around their was a couple of guy's and two girls they looked young and beautiful the two girls where hanging on the two guy's in the back the one in the front looked like their leader he was tall well build he had a black silk shirt and neat pants. "We know this town well enough... Come on let's go..." "How rude!" One of the girl's grabbed Claire's wrist.  My eye's slit I grabbed the girl's arm she quickly let go. Great vampire's moved in..."Forgive my sister you see we just moved in." I took a deep breath. "I'm Crystal and this is my friend." "Claire." "A pleasure to meet you. Are you sure you'll be alright out here?" We nodded. (Crystal)" we'll be fine... " We where fine we didn't live far from the party. I took Claire's hand and left. "That really hurt..." "Looks like a burn mark..." "Damian are you sure about those girl's?" (Damian)"They knew we weren't human.
