I live in a small village just outside the forest my mother died giving birth and no one knows who my father is...That's okay the people here are... "Rose time to till the grounds!" (Rose)"Coming!" "Hey Rose did you hear another cow was killed last night...The whole village is in an up roar." We pulled weeds from the fields all day long. (Rose)"Is that why it's so noisy today?" She nodded. "Don't you sleep out in the fields?" (Rose)"Some times but I didn't see anything." "That's probably a good thing." "I don't like you going out at night Rose." "Father." "I know you like to watch the stars but it's getting more dangerous." (Rose)"But all they kill are cattle..." "True but what if they get desperite? If they've moved from the forest their hunting grounds must be small right now...Just promise me you'll be more carefull." (Rose)"I promise." "Good now why don't you too take a break and wash up for lunch." We nodded and smiled. "Race you!" (Rose)"Your on!" We raced towards the well I came in first and my friend was out of breath. "Rose how do you do it?" I shrugged. We washed up... In the distance I thought I heard howling. "Come on Rose let's go eat." (Rose)"Okay." We ate lunch and headed back out to work till it was getting late we finished up and washed off... I waited till everyone was asleep to sneak out my faverit place to lay was out on top of the hay...Tonight was another clear night I climbed up one of the stacks of hay. I wander what would it be like to run free? I looked to the forest their standing was a wolf our eye's locked for a moment when all of a sudden I heard my name. "What are you looking at Rose?" It startled me and I fell off the hay... My friend laughed." Sorry I didn't mean to startle you." She helped me up. "Father asked me to come bring you back inside." (Rose)"Okay." She knelt down so that I could ride on her back. I got on. (Rose)"Sorry..." I started to doze off. Her dad was waiting by the door he could see that I was asleep so he picked me up and carried me to bed. I was dreaming of running through the forest but I was on all fours and I was chasing a deer...Another was with me than I woke up. "Rose hurry." I rubbed my eye's. (Rose)"What's going on?" "A wolf entered the village." (Rose)"Shouldn't we stay inside than?" "No way I want to see it don't you?" I nodded. So we snuck out hiding from the villager's .... I found some print's but they looked bigger than a wolf... We followed them. "A dead end..."We heard a growl behind us... We turned around slowly it was a white wolf but it was huge. My friend couldn't move so I got infront it sniffed me than sat down. "Your brave to stand before me little one." (Rose)"You can talk?" "Rose be careful." "Only you can understand me." (Rose)"Oh...Why did you come into our village?" "Wherent you the one star gazing?" I nodded as my face turned red. "What's it saying?" (Rose)"He was watching me watching the stars." "So he's okay?" "I won't harm you or your friend but those human's won't see it that way..." (Rose)"He's okay but he needs a way out..." "What about the hay stacks? He can hide their till everyone gives up." I nodded. We looked to make sure no one was around to sneak away we had to stop a phew times we finally got to one of the hay's he leaped in it. "Rose stay here." I nodded and hid inside.... "Why do you trust me?" I shrugged. "I am a wolf you know. (Rose)"Because you said you wouldn't hurt us." "Didn't your parent's teach you not to be so trusting?" I shook my head. (Rose)"My mother passed away after I was born...And I don't know my father." "Forgive me..." I smiled and shook my head. (Rose)"It's okay...So why have you come so close to the village?" "I'm searching for someone." (Rose)"Couldn't you hunt in the forests? It'll be safer for you that way." "I've never came near the village till tonight." (Rose)"So you haven't been killing the villager's cattle?" He shook his head. "I'm afraid..." (Rose)"I know some how I think I alway's knew I would have dream's when ever I would gaze at the stars I would drift to sleep... "Come with me my leader can help you." (Rose)"Really?" "Yes eventully your hunger will go beyond just cattle. I got onto his back and held tightly. When it was all clear he dashed out of the hay he headed towards the forest as fast as he can. He ran none stop throughout the night.
