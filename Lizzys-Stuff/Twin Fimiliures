Hey Alexis dad won't be back till late wanna go out and have some fun? (Alexis)"Didn't dad wan't us to stay inside?" "Ya but it's so boring staying stuck in the lab all the time..." I shrugged and hopped down from the table. "I guase if we don't change we could go and do something." "Thanks Alexis!" We headed out and headed towards a big park. We where having alot of fun just walking and injoying the cool breeze. We stayed until it got close to dark. (Alexis)"Let's head back..." "Why?" "It's getting late and You know it's not safe after dark..." "Okay..." Sis wouldn't than all of a sudden she attacked me I jumped out of the way. (Alexis)"Sis what's wrong?" "I...don't...know I can't control....myself." Their was a dark laughter. "Of course she can't she my puppet now." A man in silk black robes revealed himself. My sister changed to her wolf form and kept attacking. I couldn't attack my own sister so I chanted a spell Root sprung from the ground and binded my sister so she couldn't move. Than I heard a male voice telling me to close my eye's so did and a bright light exploded someone picked my sister and I up and vanished. When we stopped he gently put me down. "You can open you eye's now." I slowly opened them when I looked up the man had long white hair up in a pony tail and he had glasses. (Alexis)"Thank you for saving us...but who are you?" "He's an old friend." (Alexis)"Dad..." All of a sudden my head start to hurt really badly and everything started spinning. (Dad)"Alexis?" Dad held me close. "She resisted that man's control I'm impressed but it's taken it's toll and kept her sister from cuasing harm." (Alexis)"It's not her fualt..." I passed out."Twin famililures interesting and one know's magic." "They both do but Alexis know's more about fighting than Crystal ever since they day I adopted them both at the time I had no clue about my brother's legacy till that day they came to me. I thought I could keep them safe..." The man ajusted his glasses. "Their Familiures without a master they'll always be target's..." He looked at his friends face full of worry. "Don't worry so much once they have a master they'll be fine...Look I have a friend that might help we can see him tomorrow alright." He nodded with a sigh of releif. In the morning my sister and I both woke up at the smell of food. "Good morning I hope you don't mind a simple breakfast?" We both drooled and smiled. I looked around. (Alexis)"Where's dad?" "I sent him on an erren while you ate when he's back where going on a trip." Crystal poked me. (Crystal)"Hey who's the hottie?" (Alexis)"A friend of dad."I just relized she didn't remember last night so I just left it at that. (Alexis)"He came to pick us up while you fell asleep. You where so drooling to." (Crystal)"I never drool!" I chuckled. (Alexis)"You so where." (Crystal)"Than where's your proof?" I shrugged. She stuck her tongue at me crossing her arm's. (Alexis)"Do you have a shower?" He nodded. "Down stair's go ahead and take your time." (Alexis)"Thank's..." He asked for crystal's help while I headed down stairs I still hurt from last night... I peeled my shirt off it looked like they dressed my wounds I slowly unwrapped them and it showed claw marks. "Those look like it hurt's." I looked around and saw a tiny fairy. "Want some help?" I nodded. She grabbed a spung as I turned on the water and waited for it to warm up she saw the larg claw mark on my back. (Alexis)"You don't have to wash my back..." She shook her head. "I said I would...Does it hurt?" (Alexis)"Only some time's." I pulled my hair to the front so she could wash my back the other wounds started to heal her eye's widened as the water washed over my silver hair I giggled when we finished she brushed my hair and went upstair's. "I see you met Lilli." (Crystal)"How cute." She bowed and smiled. (Lilli)"Sebastian is breakfast ready?" (Sebastian)"Yes it's ready." We sat down and dad was just in time. It was nice to have a hot breakfast with everyone. (Sebastian)"Where you able to get the things we need?" (Dad)"Yes but wasn't easy." (Sebastian)"Once everyone is finished eating I'll start the incantation to take us to magic university." (Crystal)"A magic school?" (Sebastian)"Yes my friend is a professor there I already sent word that we would be coming. And don't worry no one is allowed to force you into a contract." We started eating Crystal was excited. After we ate Sebastian got everything ready in the next room. (Sebastian)"Now just stand in the middle of the circle." We did. Lilli sat on Sebastian's shoulders humming a tune. The circle lit up as he started the incantation. All of a sudden we where in some me kind of building with mages waiting. "Sebastian I see you made it in one piece?" (Sebastian)"More or less." The man laughed. (Sebastian)"This is the head of the school.
