Hey Alexis dad won't be back till late wanna go out and have some fun? (Alexis)"Didn't dad wan't us to stay inside?" "Ya but it's so boring staying stuck in the lab all the time..." I shrugged and hopped down from the table. "I guase if we don't change we could go and do something." "Thanks Alexis!" We headed out and headed towards a big park. We where having alot of fun just walking and injoying the cool breeze. We stayed until it got close to dark. (Alexis)"Let's head back..." "Why?" "It's getting late and You know it's not safe after dark..." "Okay..." Sis wouldn't than all of a sudden she attacked me I jumped out of the way. (Alexis)"Sis what's wrong?" "I...don't...know I can't control....myself." Their was a dark laughter. "Of course she can't she my puppet now." A man in silk black robes revealed himself. My sister changed to her wolf form and kept attacking. I couldn't attack my own sister so I chanted a spell Root sprung from the ground and binded my sister so she couldn't move. Than I heard a male voice telling me to close my eye's so did and a bright light exploded someone picked my sister and I up and vanished. When we stopped he gently put me down. "You can open you eye's now." I slowly opened them when I looked up the man had long white hair up in a pony tail and he had glasses. (Alexis)"Thank you for saving us...but who are you?" "He's an old friend." (Alexis)"Dad..." All of a sudden my head start to hurt really badly and everything started spinning. (Dad)"Alexis?" Dad held me close. "She resisted that man's control I'm impressed but it's taken it's toll and kept her sister from cuasing harm." (Alexis)"It's not her fualt..." I passed out."Twin famililures interesting and one know's magic." "They both do but Alexis know's more about fighting than Crystal ever since they day I adopted them both at the time I had no clue about my brother's legacy till that day they came to me. I thought I could keep them safe..." The man ajusted his glasses. "Their Familiures without a master they'll always be target's..." He looked at his friends face full of worry. "Don't worry so much once they have a master they'll be fine...Look I have a friend that might help we can see him tomorrow alright." He nodded with a sigh of releif.
