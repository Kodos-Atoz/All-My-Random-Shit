Alexis we have another job to do. (Alexis)"Please tell me I won't get turned into a crow again?" My boss laughed. "No nothing like that. This time it's a murder case these detectives said they needed our help on this one." He pointed at the two detectives on the couch. (Alexis)"Oh Jake and Aric hehe didn't see you there." I made some tea and coffee while they talked. Another detective came in he seemed really nervuse...Must be a newcomber. "Sir I got those permissions..." He looked down at the table with the murder pictures he looked like he was about to lose his lunch. (Alexis)"Bathrooms that way." He ran passed me. I looked at the pictures. (Jake)"We tried our best to look into the matter but as you can see it's not looking vary good." "Where is this taking place?" (Aric)"At the old mansion here." Aric handed me the files to give to my boss. (Jake)"We'll be sending the new detective with you that way he can get an idea of what's out their." I knew it...
