Children here are my age right? "Yes little one. Like you they are also force sensitive." I clasped my ear's with my small hands and tears ran down my cheeks. "Why does it hurt so much?" She held me her arm's. "I know it's hard when you can hear the planet and it's people, for now go meditate with the other's alright?" She wiped away my tears I sniffled and nodded. I ran off to the other's. I crossed my legs. My body felt like it was floating in space...  A figure stood before me. Who are you? I asked. (You can see me?) I nodded... I covered my ear's trying to drown out the screams. (Why do you turn your ear's away from the force?) It hurts... The planets in pain... I looked up the figure was closer it looked like a black sun... I blinked. As I looked in aw. "Why are you different from those around me? You're different from our teacher's... All of a sudden I heard someone calling me. " I got to go." My eye's slowly opened when my teacher saw that she sighed in relief. "What's wrong?" She patted my head. "What did I tell you about gazing in the force so long?" "I'm sorry... I was gazing at the planet..." "I know you can't help it but remember it put's a strain on your body.

I rolled over and nodded. "Am I so different?" "Did you get a talk again?" I nodded. My friend laughed. Well not really friends but she's the only one who talk's to me. "Hey are we really safe here?" She looked at me and smiled. "The Jedi's will protect us!" I nodded but some how I knew that it wasn't okay... I took a deep breath and got up. "Going already?" "Ya just to run though and maybe some practice..." "Alright but don't over do it okay!" I nodded and walked out. I did some sword training as well as visual training. My movement's where vary fluent. "Master isn't that the girl you bumped into?" He nodded. Her movements aren't wasted... Not only that but she's wielding two vibroblades. I breathed in deep and slowly let it out with each swing.
