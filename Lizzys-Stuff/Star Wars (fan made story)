Children here are my age right? "Yes little one. Like you they are also force sensitive." I clasped my ear's with my small hands and tears ran down my cheeks. "Why does it hurt so much?" She held me her arm's. "I know it's hard when you can hear the planet and it's people, for now go meditate with the other's alright?" She wiped away my tears I sniffled and nodded. I ran off to the other's. I crossed my legs. My body felt like it was floating in space...  A figure stood before me. Who are you? I asked. (You can see me?) I nodded... I covered my ear's trying to drown out the screams. (Why do you turn your ear's away from the force?) It hurts... The planets in pain... I looked up the figure was closer it looked like a black sun... I blinked. As I looked in aw. "Why are you different from those around me? You're different from our teacher's... All of a sudden I heard someone calling me. " I got to go." My eye's slowly opened when my teacher saw that she sighed in relief. "What's wrong?" She patted my head. "What did I tell you about gazing in the force so long?" "I'm sorry... I was gazing at the planet..." "I know you can't help it but remember it put's a strain on your body. Why don't you rest in the med bay alright?" I nodded and slowly got up though my whole body wobbled. Someone cuaght me. "Are you alright?" I looked up, it was a man in robes I noticed he had a lightsaber. "Yes... I'm sorry." "Master you should be careful!" "Of coarse you're right ha ha. Sorry about that." "Ah Master Javari you're early." (Javari)"Yes we where in a rush we got here and thought we had time to explore..." I whispered. He was lieing well more like hiding something. I backed away and bowed heading off to the medical room. "That girl is vary smart." "I'm sorry she's stronger in the force than the other's." I laid down on one of the bunk's. "Had a tough training?" I rolled over and nodded. "Am I so different?" "Did you get a talk again?" I nodded. My friend laughed. Well not really friends but she's the only one who talk's to me. "Hey are we really safe here?" She looked at me and smiled. "The Jedi's will protect us!" I nodded but some how I knew that it wasn't okay... I took a deep breath and got up. "Going already?" "Ya just to run though and maybe some practice..." "Alright but don't over do it okay!" I nodded and walked out. I did some sword training as well as visual training. My movement's where vary fluent. "Master isn't that the girl you bumped into?" He nodded. Her movements aren't wasted... Not only that but she's wielding two vibroblades. I breathed in deep and slowly let it out with each swing. After I finished I felt two presents watching I turned around. "Oh its just you too." "Forgive us if we interrupted." I shook my head. "I was just relaxing." I bowed than left... Heading to my bunk I laid down and closed my eye's. My dream's where always about the battle's but than everything went black... It's so empty... I saw my friend smiling and laughing I called out but she didn't look at me she started to fade so did everyone else around. Wait! Don't leave please... I'm the same aren't I? I woke up breathing hard... "Wake up your going to be late for our meditation!" "I'm awake..." We got ready and headed to the center room. The Jedi's and the others where waiting. "Okay now that everyone is here. I would like to introduce Master Javari and his young padawan as well as other Jedi that came with them. They offered to help today. So pay attention and fallow there instructions." Something seemed off they talked about making our light saber's the other's where just excited to finally build their lightsabers mine had two rare crystals it was a staff that could change to two weapon's the crystals where two halves of the same. "Vary good now lets start meditation before we start training." We sat down and closed our eye's I was in my space looking down at the planet. It still seemed sad... The echoes rang in my ear's when that figure appeared again. "Your back!" (You seem happy to see me again? And yet troubled at the same time.")I nodded. "I was the only one here... Until you showed up... Not that I don't mind...As for being troubled I made my staff lightsaber..." (A staff? You don't look happy about it.) I am it's just I don't think there telling us why their really here... (And who would that be?)" Some Jedi master..." The figure came closer. (I'll be there soon.) Huh? All of a sudden I felt someone shake me awake. When I opened my eye's everything was blurry...  Teacher held me tight. "What..." "Easy you where excuasting you're life force if it wasn't for Master Javari who noticed." Tears ran down her cheeks. I can't move...I felt a sharp pain than I blacked out. The battles getting closer... "Master will that girl be alright?" "It's hard to say she's like a storm and her body can't keep up... If she can learn to still that storm than she would be fine. Anyways keep your guard up feels like something is going to happen..." "Yes mastet." I tossed in my sleep those words echoed in my mind...The figure who was a black sun I felt fear and yet excitement at the same time... Than a loud noise woke me up. Whats that sound... The teacher picked me up and carried me to where the other's where it was a small bunker in the back of the a room. "Stay here understand?" Everyone nodded. "What's... Going on?" She shook her head and closed these huge bulk door's. Some of the kids where scared but others wanted to fight. We huddled together as we heard explosion and blasters going off. Than we heard who ever they where fighting force the door open but no one could... Could they?
