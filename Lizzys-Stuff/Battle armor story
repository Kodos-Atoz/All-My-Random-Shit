Everyone activate your armor suits and let's get the camp started. Everyone started to activate their armor's. I took a deep breath and activated mine it was black with red trim mine is a beast type. I walked to the starting point first was a race to get to the next challenge their where many groups out their... “Ready! Set go!” Everyone darted off their where two strong groups in front of me one was the White knights their pretty strong but their not my type now the Dark dragon's on the other hand are awesome their leader is really skilled but he hardly takes part in any activity's except for group battles. We got to the next challenge this time it was a team challenge since I wasn't in a team I went into a random team this challenge you use team work to get across a course With picking up ball and passing it to your team mate. "Hey over here!" "I'm comeing!" While I waited for my turn I equipped just my boots and claw's It was my turn I grabbed the ball and dashed off. Once I got to the side the other's where in a panic. "What's wrong?" "Alexis our balls aren't here we can't finish the race..." (Alexis)"Don't panic did anyone see anything?" They shook their head I sighed. "Well we can still finish but will lose points but I'd rather lose points than lose completely now get running!" (All)"Right!" Is she seirus? Shh that's Alexis you don't want to mess with her... Why she has no group... "I'd take a closer look she hasn't move and yet everyone can't look away." "Hey boss that's rare of you..." He shrugs. I crouch down on all fours grinning the air around me trembled I waited for my team to finish in a blink of an eye I already the finish line. I walked and noticed Damian watching for a second I thought I saw him smiling than I heard everyone whispering. "Alright everyone take a break than will take everyone to the next challenge!" I went to shower and change. After taking a shower I got into a new combat suit it was made for my beast armor wasn't heavy but you couldn't put a dent in it. While I waited I relaxed on a window seal. The next challenge probably survival next... Meaning this'll be fun... A group walked up to me and their leader called me out. "Why don't you fight me!" I grind. (Alexis)"Sure but let me warn you don't blame me if you don't walk out of it unscathed." The group sneared and scolfed at me. "So than let's fight!" I nodded and fallowed until they stopped in the clearing I stood on the other side crossing my arms we both activated our armor's, alot of teams where watching I grind the leader pulled his sword. "Where's your weapon?!" I smiled and held out my claw energy started to build the air crackled. "Hey isn't that Alexis?" "Ya the new guys challenged her she never holds back..."
