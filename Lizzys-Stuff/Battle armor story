Everyone activate your armor suits and let's get the camp started. Everyone started to activate their armor's. I took a deep breath and activated mine it was black with red trim mine is a beast type. I walked to the starting point first was a race to get to the next challenge their where many groups out their... “Ready! Set go!” Everyone darted off their where two strong groups in front of me one was the White knights their pretty strong but their not my type now the Dark dragon's on the other hand are awesome their leader is really skilled but he hardly takes part in any activity's except for group battles. We got to the next challenge this time it was a team challenge since I wasn't in a team I went into a random team this challenge you use team work to get across a course With picking up ball and passing it to your team mate. "Hey over here!" "I'm comeing!" While I waited for my turn I equipped just my boots and claw's It was my turn I grabbed the ball and dashed off.
