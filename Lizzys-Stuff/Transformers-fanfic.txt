I was being transported from one of cybertrons secret lab while
I was in stasis The ship was on its way to an out post when a decepticon intercepted the ships signal. "This is Knock out prepare to intercept that ship!"Yes sir! Where getting three signals sir and one is faint. " Hm must be a transport ship disable it!"Knock out's ship fired at the other ship it fired back as it tried to escape but Knock out fired a ion pulse disabling the ship. "Time to board."The dicepticons boarded the one of the bots onboard held them off and told the other to secure the cargo so the other bot ran to the cargo and sealed the behind him the other quickly fallowed but was struck down by knock out. The doors opened it looked liked the bot entered. "What are you doing we got to distroy..." before he could finish knock out dropped him.Knock out saw a tank behind the bot inside was me a dragnoid knock out brush aside the bot standing before him. "Whats this an autobot?" knock out pulled up the data but since it was incrypted he openend a space bridge and took the pod with him once on board his ship he secured the pod he returned to the bridge. "Set cordanits to my lab."They did just that and headed off to one of his labs. Once at the lab he hooked the pod up and started decripting the data than Magatron showed up with Shockwave."Lord Megatron what an unexpected surprise..." "Not as mutch as this what are you working on?" "It was on a cargo ship its nether autobot or a decepticon but thats all i got the data's incrypted." "Im putting Shockwave in charge." Shockwave started decripting the data fast. Warning dragonoid feeds on any energon inkluding dark energon and must remain in stasis till we can control her to seek out more energon..
