We walked out of training camp and went to an open plains area our mission was to camp without weapons for a few days Aric wanted to sleep outside i laughed but its not unheard of by him. We set up camp I helped set up the tent.(Aric)"Hey Alexis I'll go gather food can you make a pit for a fire?" I nodded.
