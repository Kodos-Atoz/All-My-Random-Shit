Alexis don't forget to finish your home work before bed. (Alexis)"I will." "My Lord tonight's a full moon perfect for some fright's. I bet that human's still awake to my lord.' A man sitting in his throne opened his eye's they where red and slit, he had long black hair with pointed ear's fang's and claws. He has a long tail amd horns his body was covered in tribale tattoos his clothes where black and red silk his chest was alway's showing he had piercing's on his ear's. He grind. (Lord)"Perfect night to go fetch her." Ah this home work is annoying...had to be math. The room went dark red the moon went red also. "Alexis arent you tired of that human stuff?" (Alexis)"Damian?" I turned around and he was sitting on my bed. (Damian)"I've come for you." He got up and came over to me he held out his hand. "Sha'll we?" I nodded and smiled. He picked me up a circle appeared and we vanished. I'm dateing the king of the monster realm well I say dating but he want's me to marry him in human terms where dating but in his realm where already ingaged. When ever I'm in his realm I'm no longer human it feel's great though I'm still getting use to having wing's and a tail. Damian let me down on my feet he looked at me. (Alexis)"What's wrong? Is it my clothes?" He clasped my chin and kissed me deeply. His tongue danced with mine he broke off the kiss. (Damian)"Let's get you different clothes." I fallowed Damian to his room his sister was waiting with a smile. She snapped her finures and my clothes shreaded apart... (Alexis)"My mom's gonna kill me..." Damian helped me get changed though he took his time. I wore silk with skull's on my pelvis and covering my chest though barely. "Perfect! Brother dear have you tought Alexis magic yet?" He shook his head.
