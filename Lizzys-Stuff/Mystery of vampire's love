"Get out for real?So what does he want you to do exactly?"(Alexis)" Thats just it he doesn't want much all he wants is help managing his business he was going to pay for me to go to him." "It sounds like you already got the job if he's going that far when do you leave?" "Tomorrow is when my train leaves.""You know if he turns out to be bad..."" I can protect my self besides I need this..." "I know but I'm still going to miss you..." "You just like my cooking."We both laughed but it was true she loves my cooking. We went out and partied and went out to dinner. In the morning I started packing I didn't have much except a lot of clothes after packing decided to take a nap before I had to be on a train the whole time.While I slept I was having nightmare's it's the same one every time my adopted parents died but I survived some how." Alexis wake up your having a nightmare!" I darted up I was sweating my best friend rubbed my back I slowed my breathing."Thanks Amanda.What time is it?" "Almost time for your train come on you got to get ready." I nodded and got up."I'm going to take a quick shower." "Alright I'll get you're things together are you sure your okay?" "Ya I'm okay really." I cracked a smile than headed to the bathroom shower I turned on the water and washed up I felt really drained I shook off that feeling turning off the and dried off than I got dressed into clean clothes.We headed out to the nearest train station we hugged and said our good bye's I waved as I got onto the train while it slowly departed. I went inside to find my seat it wasn't as packed as I thought it was going to be I found my seat and sat down apparently I was sitting next to a detective he didn't talk much was fine I just read a book the whole way.After so many stops I was ready to get off at the last one.I got off carrying my bags this place seemed like something out of Amanda's horror films I took a deep breath.I saw a carriage waiting out front.The driver put my bags inside and me up.We started moving through the village their was no one in sight though it was almost night time maybe theirs a curfew or they turn in early. We drove pretty far we passed through the village through a thick forest most of the time I just read my book than we came a crossed a huge bridge witch led to a beautiful castle I couldn't take my eye's off it. It really is a castle amazing! An old gate opened up as we passed through. I put my book away when we got to the entrance
