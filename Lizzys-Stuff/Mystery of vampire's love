"Get out for real?So what does he want you to do exactly?"(Alexis)" Thats just it he doesn't want much all he wants is help managing his business he was going to pay for me to go to him." "It sounds like you already got the job if he's going that far when do you leave?" "Tomorrow is when my train leaves.""You know if he turns out to be bad..."" I can protect my self besides I need this..." "I know but I'm still going to miss you..." "You just like my cooking."We both laughed but it was true she loves my cooking. We went out and partied and went out to dinner. In the morning I started packing I didn't have much except a lot of clothes after packing decided to take a nap before I had to be on a train the whole time.While I slept I was having nightmare's it's the same one every time my adopted parents died but I survived some how." Alexis wake up your having a nightmare!" I darted up I was sweating my best friend rubbed my back I slowed my breathing."Thanks Amanda.What time is it?" "Almost time for your train come on you got to get ready." I nodded and got up."I'm going to take a quick shower." "Alright I'll get you're things together are you sure your okay?" "Ya I'm okay really." I cracked a smile than headed to the bathroom shower I turned on the water and washed up I felt really drained I shook off that feeling turning off the and dried off than I got dressed into clean clothes.We headed out to the nearest train station we hugged and said our good bye's I waved as I got onto the train while it slowly departed. I went inside to find my seat it wasn't as packed as I thought it was going to be I found my seat and sat down apparently I was sitting next to a detective he didn't talk much was fine I just read a book the whole way.After so many stops I was ready to get off at the last one.I got off carrying my bags this place seemed like something out of Amanda's horror films I took a deep breath.I saw a carriage waiting out front.The driver put my bags inside and me up.We started moving through the village their was no one in sight though it was almost night time maybe theirs a curfew or they turn in early. We drove pretty far we passed through the village through a thick forest most of the time I just read my book than we came a crossed a huge bridge witch led to a beautiful castle I couldn't take my eye's off it. It really is a castle amazing! An old gate opened up as we passed through. I put my book away when we got to the entrance the stopped the driver helped me out and handed my bags over than he was gone just like that."Well than that wasn't a bit rude much...This place is amazing!" "Thank you." A voice came from the front doors it was the same one I talked over the phone with.He was definitely as sexy as he sounded though his clothes where old fashion and I mean old but some how it went well with his pale skin and black he was tall a well built. "Your going to catch a cold why don't we go inside and warm up." "Okay." He let me go in first the place was beautiful the floors where real wood their where dim lights it was breath taking how it lit everything up but wasn't harsh on the eye's."Why don't we get you things put away than we can talk about work over tea." I nodded and fallowed him down a hallway we came to a door that looked hand crafted wood he opened the door."This is your room I hope you like it." "Its beautiful." Their where red silk on the bed my favorite colors."I love the color's spicily the red its my favorite."He smiled which sent a chill down my spine. I shook off the feeling and put my bags down next to the bed I saw a fireplace."Come let's go to the living area and get you warmed up." I fallowed."You a nice place..." "Damian." "Right Damian sorry." "No need to apologize I'm sure you a long journey." We sat down in front of a fireplace."So Alexis right?" I nodded." "Would you like to work here?" "Yes but I thought I needed to be interviewed first?" Damian laughed." When we talked I already had my answers I just wanted yours in person." I was speechless."When should I start?" "Now if you want though I have to warn you I'm not good with computer's so everything's on paper." I giggled." That's fine." "My partner says I should start learning though." Darn he's got someone."business partner."He looked at me like he could tell what I was thinking."Right." I laughed nervously. Way to go Alexis. Damian got up and got a lot of books he sat them down in front of me than went to get some tea while I looked through. He wasn't kidding all of it was hand written good thing I'm use to paperwork. Damian brought tea and sat down next to me."Your pretty good at that." "Thanks my mom told me I should work on both." "She sounds pretty smart." My face changed."Ya she was..." I tried to force a smile. It was a long night morning was almost approaching and dozed off Damian carried me off to bed. He left. I was dreaming of my patents we where eating dinner and laughing than the next thing I know our cabin was unguided in flames I felt like I was suffocating gasping for air I woke up clutching Damian he wrapped his arms around me.(Damian)"Your alright take slow breaths."His voice was soft I felt myself calming down when he spoke I realized I was crying my face turned red.(Alexis)"I'm sorry..."He stopped me.(Damian)"Did you have a nightmare?"     
 I nodded. (Alexis)"I hope I didn't wake you..."He shook his head still holding me close.(Damian)"I was already awake it is nightfall after all.Will you tell me about your dream over a meal perhaps?" I nodded.He helped me out of bed than waited for me to get dressed for some reason I got the impression he wanted to watch the way he grind but I asked him to leave so I could dressed he looked disappointed I rolled my eyes he grind again and walked out.I got dressed Damian was waiting outside the door.I fallowed behind Damian he led me to a beautiful library with a fireplace.(Alexis)"Wow this place is amazing! Theirs so many books."Damian smiled and showed me a couch to sit down on I smiled than sat down. I took a deep breath.(Damian)"I'm glad you like it I'll make us something to eat." I nodded than curled up in a ball.Damian left the room for awhile. Why does it feel okay to relax here? I sighed. Isn't this what I wanted I mean why else would I... Damian came in with food and two cups.(Damian)" I hope you like chicken parmesan."(Alexis)"It Smell's delicious." He smiled.(Damian)"So tell me about your dream."(Alexis)"I'm with my foster parents on a trip we owned a cabin. It started out fine we where eating dinner and talking but than I'm surrounded by flames my doctor said I'm trying to relive something I couldn't remember...
