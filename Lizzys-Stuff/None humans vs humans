Alright class settle down. Everyone sat down and was quiet. (Teacher)"Today we have a transfer student." A boy entered he had long white hair. "He's from over sea's so make him feel welcome." "Hi my name is Yuki I hope to make friemd's while I'm here." (Teacher)" Alright Yuki you can sit next to Alexis." He nodded and walked over and sat down in the seat next to mine. His voice was calm but something about what he said was a lie... Well what ever. The teacher went on to teaching. After class I headed to our next class when Yuki called me. (Yuki)"Hey hold up. Alexis." I stopped and turned around. (Alexis)"Yes?" "Do you know where science class is?" I nodded. "I'm heading their right now.I can show you if you want?" He smiled and nodded. We headed to the next class and sat down. A new teacher came in...He also had long white hair but his was tied up and he wore glasses. He waited for everyone to come in and get seated. "My name is Fukushima Masaharu and I'll be you new science teacher." Everybody was whispering and shocked but the girl's was just giggling of how cute he looked... "I know this is sudden but I hope you'll bare with me today." I started to get a headace but I shrugged it off. The whole time I could see everyone's aura... After class I quickly ran out of their to clear my head heading to the roof where I usaly go to clear my head. Today's been so wierd... I laid down and staired at the sky. I tried to make sense of it all the new teacher and a new student... Ug.. I rubbed my head and sat up. I leaped off the place I was laying down on when I landed I noticed Yuki in the door. We sat and talked. "So do you alway's come up here?" I nodded. "Ya I get headace's alot so it's my get away." "I hope I'm not bothering you?" I shook my head. "Not at all." I raised my hand to the skies. "Yuki why did you say you wanted friend's when you didn't mean it?" He looked at me and laughed. "It's not that I don't it's just that...It's hard for me to be around other's." "Your hanging out with me arent you?" He smiled. "True but your different." The science teacher came out here. "Their you are Yuki you forgot you medicine." "Oh I forgot...Thank's." "Are you to related?" Yuki laughed. "He's my guardian."
