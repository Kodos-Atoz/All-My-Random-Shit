The spirit world it's a place for spirit's and guardians to be. Today is a spiecle day for us guardians since we get a day off. I was drinking orange juice when I could sense something slip through our barrier. Ah and I was just getting to relaxing to... "If you want I can take care of it?" "Nah its just a small one." Theirs all types of spirit's theirs good bad and some that are dangerous the smaller ones just like to cause trouble... I walked around my tail waving back and fourth. After searching and no luck I headed to a hut. "No luck huh?" I shook my head than all of a sudden I fell unconscious. A stronger spirit smiled wickedly and distroyed the weaker spirit. When I awoke I couldn't sense any spirit's... "Hey tigress are you alright?" I nodded. (Tigress)"Ya I'm okay...maybe I should head back...." "But you can't go back." "Why not?" "Don't you remember your a caged wolf now." This nightmare... Do you want to be free? Who's their? Time's have changed... Time to wake up!" I opened my eye's to see a man with a mask but his Aurora was suffocating... "Master we should go before the humans arrive." He walked up to me. "Tell me do you want to be free? A wolf shouldn't be caged." Tears ran down my cheeks. "Serve me and I promise the humans will never harm you again." I nodded. He smiled and broke the chains catching me as I fall. "Let's go!" Everyone vanished into black mist. We ended up an a large Japanese style mansion. "Welcome back master... Oh my what happened?" "Where back. Oh this we found her in a cave all chaind up." She gasped. "How awful... We should get her cleaned up!" "Good I'm counting on you to take care of her." "Yes master right away.!"
