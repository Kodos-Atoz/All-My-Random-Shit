The spirit world it's a place for spirit's and guardians to be. Today is a spiecle day for us guardians since we get a day off. I was drinking orange juice when I could sense something slip through our barrier. Ah and I was just getting to relaxing to... "If you want I can take care of it?" "Nah its just a small one." Theirs all types of spirit's theirs good bad and some that are dangerous the smaller ones just like to cause trouble... I walked around my tail waving back and fourth. After searching and no luck I headed to a hut. "No luck huh?" I shook my head than all of a sudden I fell unconscious. A stronger spirit smiled wickedly and distroyed the weaker spirit. When I awoke I couldn't sense any spirit's... "Hey tigress are you alright?" I nodded. (Tigress)"Ya I'm okay...
