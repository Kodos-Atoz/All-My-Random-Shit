Hey Rose let's celebrate tonight at a new club. "Alexis why?" (Alexis)"Just because it's you're birthday." I sighed. "Come on for me" "Fine but can't stay out long alright... Just because I'm 21 now doesn't mean I can be out late..." "Don't worry I won't keep you long though if you ask me you should leave that place. Your adobted parents suck you know that..? I knew she was right...but I wanted to find a place of my own and a job. " Earth to rose come on!" "Comeing!" Alexis took me shopping we where returning to her car on the other side when my head started to hurt I grabbed Alexis and told her to stop she did than a car ran a red light. (Alexis)"Jirk! Rose your a life saver screw what your parent's say you're awesome." I smiled. "Even though I know what your thinking and feeling?" She nodded. "Now let's go have fun okay." "Okay." We got to her car and she drove us to a club that looked strange. "Come on Rose." I rolled my eye's and got out. We showed our cards to the security he let us in. The place wasn't varey bright other than the dim lights we got to the bar. (Bartender) "What will it be tonight?" (Alexis)"Something light for my friend and something mild for now." "You got it." I whispered to Alexis. "Is this really a club?" She nodded and smiled. "Wait till you meet the guy's here. Their suppose to be meeting us soon." "Guy's? Alexis had that look. (Alexis)" Remember I told you I started dating someone right." I nodded. "Well he asked me out but said I should bring a friend to... I know I should of asked but your my only best friend forgive me?" She looked apologetic. I smiled and nodded she squealed and hugged me. "Sorry where late." A voice was behind wich made me jump. "Sorry didn't mean to startle you." "Aric!" Alexis leaped into his arms. Their where him and a guy next to him they both looked hot and really young. (Alexis)"Sorry he-he Rose this is Aric my boyfriend and this is Rose my best friend." (Aric)"A pleasure to meet you. This is Damian." I smiled. (Rose)"Hi it's nice to meet you to." I looked over at Damian and noticed he was looking right at me I felt my face getting red. Alexis giggled. "Shall we go sit in the back room tonight?"(Aric)"Yes and could you bring these lady's something to eat?" "Alright if you'll fallow me." We fallowed the bartender to a room in the back that said VIP room. We sat down Alexis wouldn't let go of Aric's arm though it looked like he didn't mind. (Alexis)"So what took you?" Aric smiled. Aric pulled out a box and gave it to Alexis. She smiled as she opened it. (Alexis)"Aww its beautiful thanks Aric." She held up a red jewel necklace Aric placed it around her neck. I smiled while sipping my drink. (Aric)"Looks like your friend fell asleep. " (Alexis)"Don't wake her she need's it... Since it's her birthday." "Why didn't you say so?" "Because she hates her birthday... Thanks to her parents... Could you carry to my car so I could take her my place?" (Aric)"No way are you driving! We'll take you home and no arguing." She nodded. "Damian could you carry her?" (Damian)"Sure..." Damian got up and reached out for me when he puased he saw tears running down my face while the two weren't looking he wiped the tears away and carefully picked me up. He carried me to Arics car and buckled me into the back seat the other two fallowed behind. Alexis called my mom she got an earfull before getting off the phone. Aric dropped us off he didn't want to leave us alone but Alexis insisted after giving Damian a piece of paper with a phone number. (Alexis)"That's Rose's number."She winked. (Damian)"Are you sure?" She nodded with a smile. (Aric)"Call me if you need anything promise?" "I will promise." They left after Damian covered me. Alexis took everything off except my underwear. She sat on the edge getting undressed herself I came up from behind and hugged her planting my face in her back she clasped my hands. "I'm sorry..." She smiled. "Don't be sorry now get some sleep okay." I nodded and closed my eye's. (Rose)"Alexis." "Yes?" "Thanks. I had fun tonight." "I'm glad. Hey did you have any headaces?" I shook my head. "Actuly no...It was so quiet I must of just dozed off." "Isn't your dad retired military?" I nodded falling back to sleep. Alexis smiled and wasn't far behind me. I woke up someone was trying to get in the apartment. I quietly woke Alexis up telling her to be quiet... I know that energy... Alexis texted Aric. (Can you come? I think someone's trying to break in!") (Alright stay hidden where on our way.) Our hearts where pounding when the noise stopped than we heard Arics voice, Alexis opened the door and jumped into his arms crying. (Aric)" Are you girls alright?" Alexis nodded still barrieing her face in his chest. I grasp my arm's shaking Alexis must of noticed she knew that I only get this way when it involves my dad. (Damian)" Looked like who ever was here ran off..." Damian stopped. We where still in our underwear. I blushed than tried to find my clothes Alexis helped. (Alexis)" Here's some jeans." Alexis handed me them I took them. "Thanks." I started to put them on but was having issues than I finaly got them on. My hair was in the way I grew it really long just a little bit passed my back wich covered two scars on my back I quickly grabbed my shirt and put it on. (Aric)" I think we should take you girls to our place is that alright?" I was going to protest when Alexis held me. (Alexis)" He's right please you can't go home..." I nodded. "Your right..." Damian held out his hand for me. I took it as he helped me up. When Damian took her hand he saw something her emotions flooded his mind she was scared to death. Alexis got dressed and we gathered extra clothes than left the girls where in the middle of Aric and Damian Alexis was on Arics arm just before we where free a man blocked our path. (Rose)" Dad!" He looked mad and really drunk... Aric stepped infront of Alexis. "Rose get your ass home now!" I stepped back and shook my head. (Aric)" She doesn't want to." He glared. "Who the hell are you?" Damian wrapped his arm around me I blushed. (Aric)" Where taking these lovely lady's out on a date I would apreiciate it if you wouldn't bother them. Dad didn't say a word. "Now if you'll excuse us will be leaving." Dad stepped aside we passed by he looked out of it. When we got to Arics car I gasped
