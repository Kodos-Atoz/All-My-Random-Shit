Our uncle was taking us out to his cabin. My cousins where listening to music. (Uncle)"What's up Rose didn't get enough sleep?" I yawned. (Rose)"I had another strange dream." (Uncle)"Running through the forest again?" I nodded. (Rose)"It's amazing but it keeps wearing me out more than gym class..." My uncle laughed. (Uncle)"Are you excited for your first turn? Or scared?" (Rose)"Both. I'm really excited but I'm scared that I'll mess up..." (Uncle)"Don't worry we'll be their with you and it'll be the twins first time as well. Your aunt wish's you luck to she wished she could be here but the baby's keeping her busy." I giggled. "You'll be fine cuz." (Rose)"Thanks." I'm also nervuse about meeting my father for the first time... I sighed. "Want to switch you can take a nap back here." I nodded so we switched we where use to taking turns. I watched the tree's pass by I couldn't keep my eye's open any longer. "And she's out like a light." (Uncle)"Let her sleep, we'll be their by noon." Hours went by when I woken we pulled off to a side road their was a sign saying No trespassing. I yawned. After driving awhile I could see our cabin up ahead. Uncle parked the car and got out while the twins rushed out of the car to go play Jake and I grabbed our bags from the trunk. I looked up and Uncle was talking to someone. (Rose)"Who's that?" (Jake)"
