The castle has always been my cage though sometimes I'm able to walk outside at night often I would listen to story's from some of the guard's. One night I left my room for a walk when I heard one of the guards speak about a king that was advancing his army... I wish he'd attack here... But if he did... I sighed and headed back to my room... I looked around before flying into my window. One of the Knight's was their waiting. "How long are you going to keep sneaking out?" I chuckled nervously. "You know I hate being cooped up in this castle..." "Well you better stop you're highness I won't be here to bail you out if you get caught." "Are you leaving already?" He walked over and patted my head. "Yes I'm leaving at first light. So be good until my return." I nodded. "I'm sorry I wish I could take you with me and free you." I shook my head. Of course I want to but not if it causes the only person who talks to me trouble. "Get some sleep." I nodded as I slipped into bed and yawned. I closed my eye's when he left I barried my face in my pillow... I tossed and turned when I awoke to a strange feeling... I got out of bed and slowly opened my door.. The guards where no where in sight. The feeling was coming.
