The castle has always been my cage though sometimes I'm able to walk outside at night often I would listen to story's from some of the guard's. One night I left my room for a walk when I heard one of the guards speak about a king that was advancing his army... I wish he'd attack here... But if he did... I sighed and headed back to my room... I looked around before flying into my window. One of the Knight's was their waiting. "How long are you going to keep sneaking out?" I chuckled nervously. "You know I hate being cooped up in this castle..." "Well you better stop you're highness I won't be here to bail you out if you get caught." "Are you leaving already?" He walked over and patted my head. "Yes I'm leaving at first light. So be good until my return." I nodded. "I'm sorry I wish I could take you with me and free you." I shook my head. Of course I want to but not if it causes the only person who talks to me trouble. "Get some sleep." I nodded as I slipped into bed and yawned. I closed my eye's when he left I barried my face in my pillow... I tossed and turned when I awoke to a strange feeling... I got out of bed and slowly opened my door.. The guards where no where in sight. I walked to my sister's room even though where not blood related she still treats me like her own sister. Mary was still asleep I walked towards her than got in bed next to her and cuddled close. (Mary)" Can't sleep?" I nodded... "Can I tell you something my little fire breather?" I looked at her and nodded. Sis named me that hehe its a little nickname. "Do you want to leave this place?" "I do but not without you or my other sisters..." She smiled. "What if I told you we could." "What do you mean?" "Do you remember I told you I found someone that I fell in love with?" I nodded. "Well He's comeing... with an army." "Are you talking about that army? The one that comes during the night without warning?" She nodded. "Don't say anything but he's not human...Well he's a vampire." My eye's widened. "Have you met him?" "He's supose to meet me tomorrow night... I made a deal. But It's strange even without meeting him I feel that I love him." "If that's what you want than I'll help." She smiled. We both went to sleep. The next day I went back to my room all I could think about was what sis told me. Than I saw a letter on my bed... I opened it up and read it... It was from the knight... He knew...He was the one who set it up. Go figure... I read the rest.
