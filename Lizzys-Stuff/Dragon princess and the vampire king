The castle has always been my cage though sometimes I'm able to walk outside at night often I would listen to story's from some of the guard's. One night I left my room for a walk when I heard one of the guards speak about a king that was advancing his army... I wish he'd attack here... But if he did... I sighed and headed back to my room... I looked around before flying into my window. One of the Knight's was their waiting. "How long are you going to keep sneaking out?" I chuckled nervously. "You know I hate being cooped up in this castle..." "Well you better stop you're highness I won't be here to bail you out if you get caught." "Are you leaving already?" He walked over and patted my head. "Yes I'm leaving at first light. So be good until my return." I nodded. "I'm sorry I wish I could take you with me and free you." I shook my head. Of course I want to but not if it causes the only person who talks to me trouble. "Get some sleep." I nodded as I slipped into bed and yawned. I closed my eye's when he left I barried my face in my pillow... I tossed and turned when I awoke to a strange feeling... I got out of bed and slowly opened my door.. The guards where no where in sight. I walked to my sister's room even though where not blood related she still treats me like her own sister. Mary was still asleep I walked towards her than got in bed next to her and cuddled close. (Mary)" Can't sleep?" I nodded... "Can I tell you something my little fire breather?" I looked at her and nodded. Sis named me that hehe its a little nickname. "Do you want to leave this place?" "I do but not without you or my other sisters..." She smiled. "What if I told you we could." "What do you mean?" "Do you remember I told you I found someone that I fell in love with?" I nodded. "Well He's comeing... with an army." "Are you talking about that army? The one that comes during the night without warning?" She nodded. "Don't say anything but he's not human...Well he's a vampire." My eye's widened. "Have you met him?" "He's supose to meet me tomorrow night... I made a deal. But It's strange even without meeting him I feel that I love him." "If that's what you want than I'll help." She smiled. We both went to sleep. The next day I went back to my room all I could think about was what sis told me. Than I saw a letter on my bed... I opened it up and read it... It was from the knight... He knew...He was the one who set it up. Go figure... I read the rest. The king fell in love with Mary while back, once I told him what was going on he vowed to save her in return to save her siblings as well. I know you want to leave these walls as much as you're sister's. Tonight he will come will need you're help keep you're sister's safe till than. Only a phew knows of this so you must keep it secret... You're magic is the best in the kingdom place an illusion to hide your sister's until tonight have everyone think everything's still like it is. Be carful your still a princess. Hehe that's easy. First thing's first I'll put my sister's asleep and than cast the illusion spell. I started chanting. My sisters fell into a deep sleep of coarse they where having good dreams than I cast an illusion spell on the entire kingdom... I made sure of who went where. I kept it up all day...once in awhile I would eat a little bit still maintaining my magic... When it was time I still kept the illusion till everyone was asleep except the guard's. Than I heard the knight Rose... You can drop the illusion now. My eye's went back to normal as I looked up. "You did good... Come on let's get your sister's." I nodded when we walked into the corridors a man in black armor carried Mary. He was tall well build his skin was pale and his eye's where crimson red, his hair was long and black as night."Rose you can rest now." "But if I do the spell will be undone..." I looked at Mary than I caught the Kings gaze all of a sudden I felt tired. The knight caught me as I drifted off to sleep. (Vampire king)"Is that everyone?" Figure's appeared from the Shadow's holding the sister's. They nodded. They headed off into the night. When I awoke I saw fire I sat up and looked around my sister's where laughing and eating. Mary came to me. (Mary)"Your awake? Good you must be starving after all that work." She handed me a leaf with cooked fish. As I ate I heard some Knight's and other's talking... "We'll have to find a place to sleep..." "Our Knight's can safly move them in the day than you can catch up at night." One sighed. "That won't work..." The head knight looked at mary... Something was off... (Knight)"Where's rose?" Mary shrugged while trying not to smile. He rubbed his temples. "She should be resting..." I flew on top of his head in my small dragon form.(Rose)"I was but you guy's where talking to much... Besides I wanted to stretch my wing's. " "So what did you see?" I chuckled. "I found some kind of temple in this forest it looks abandoned... I can place a barrier so the sun won't come through. It's a long distance though..." (King)"Where?" I was shocked that I fell off of the Knight's head... But someone caught me. (King)"Sorry." The king lifted me up. His eye's softened for a moment. I shook my head. (Rose)"It's up a ways if you fallow the river than go passed some waterfall." "Can you show me?" I nodded and flew up high. The king was right next to me. I heard mary say be careful. I nodded and we headed off.I showed him where I saw the temple but he couldn't see it... "Where is it?" "It's hidden behind an illuson." I landed on his shoulders and let him see what I saw. "Did you create this?" I nodded and smiled. "Illusions one of my spieclty's." "This is a perfect place to set up camp." He headed back to tell the other's I hopped off his shoulder and curled up in one of my sister's lap. When everyone was ready I grew bigger so that my sister's could ride on me. I was a tad bigger than a horse. The knight's and other's fallowed. I ran all the way their...Once we arrived I let everyone down than collapsed turning back to human I was fast asleep. Mary covered me up and the Knight carried me inside. "The barriers still holding." (King)" Barrior?" One of the knights nodded. "It's part of her Illusion she can sleep and it wont bring it down." (Knight)" She can do Illusions that arent stationarey witch she can sleep through but ones like today she has to stay awake for...I wish we didn't need her power's but..." Mary smiled and shook her head. (Mary)" You know she would do anything even if you hadn't asked..." (King)" Mind if I ask? Who is she?" "She's A dragon princess sadly bound by us human's our father took her in...but when they died they bound her to the castle...Not physicly but she would never leave us...They used that agaisnt her." Mary looked sad as she rubbed my hair. (King)" Everyone should get some rest morning is almost upon us. Take turns guarding." Everyone picked a spot and laid down while two knights stood guard. I tossed and turned mumbling in my sleep I was dreaming of steaks and meat. I stood up but I was still asleep I walked passed the head knight he tried calling my name but he saw that look in my face I was out of it. One of the king's fallower's followed me. I walked around like I was looking for something. I stopped and crouched down in a clearing their was a deer eating berry's I started to drool. I waited than pounced holding the deer on my jaws. The vampire was a little impressed he just stood back and watched when my ears perked up while I was eating a larger animal showed up... Hey thats a big beast... I backed up snarling but than two little beasts fallowed behind the big one. I dropped the deer and backed up. The mom and little ones slowly came up to the deer and eyed me but I just walked away. I sighed. Now that I'm awake I'm still hungery... than a man jumped out of no where holding a rabbit. "Here It's not much..." When he looked at me my eye's lit up I was smiling and drooling. He handed it to me. (Rose)" Thank you." I dug in the meat was yummy if a bit tuff but meats meat. after I finished I left the remains for another animal than searched for a place to wash up...but all I could smell was breakfast...than I remembered the river was nearby. The man stayed with me the whole time wich I didn't mind. We came up to the falls. I ran up to it looking around I washed my face and claws. "Um would it be okay if I bathed?" The man nodded and kept his eye's on the suroundings. The king showed up next to the man. He bowed. (king)" Good work brother." He smiled. "Should you be here?" The king laughed. (king)" I can rest later. Are you worried about her?" I was swimming around my hair was white as snow my eye's where red like gems my scales shined through the water. "Hey what's so funny?" (king)"Just talking! Hows the water?" I shrugged. "Cold but feels great!" All of a sudden I felt something tug on my leg but nothing was their... I squeeled... then it squeezed pulling me under. "Hey whats wrong!?" I gasped for air. "I don't know but something's got my leg..." Good thing I can hold my breath for a long time... When I went under I looked to see what had my leg... I didn't like what I saw... A spirit...The two men jumped in one grabbed my arm as the other grabbed my waist. they could budge I pointed down and let them see what I saw. The king went down to sever what was grabbing me while his brother brought me to the surface. We got out of the water in a hurry... I panted as I laid on my back I looked up... "This is not good... We got to wake everyone and get out of this forest!" "Get on my back It'll be faster." I nodded and hopped onto his back. We ran back to camp... The king told the knight to wake everyone up. He did. "Whats going on?" (King)" This forest has spirits..." "How is this place safe?" "My barriors still holding...But It wont for long...When night falls anyways. I can carry everyone on my back the rest can keep up under my barror I can protect you from the sun. But we should leave now." Everyone packed up I grew to a huge dragon everyone was able to get on including the vampire's they where light...I shrunk the barrior to protect everyone I even grabbed the horses I flew out of the temple...At first some of the vampires kinda braced themselves but I chuckled. (Hold on tight!) The barrior fluxes...I flew the whole and glided on the wind when it picked up. Almost out of the danger zone...I could see the edge of the forest. (How are you holding up Rose?) (I'm okay hehe I can keep going.) (Okay but don't push yourself once it hits night time take a break alright?) I nodded. We broke out of the tree's and headed onwards. phew that was tuff... Mary rubbed my scales. "Good job my little fire breather." I purred.The sun started to go down after hours of flying. (King)"Rose take us down."I nodded and descended. I gently let the horses down than everyone else.My sister's got on the horses with the knight's as I turned back I was esxousted...The king's brother wrapped me up in a cloak and carried me.
