Are you sure no one lives here? "Ya I'm sure. My dad said no one lived here for a long time." "So why are we here than?" "Alexis your the only one who can see stuff plus I lost a bet..." I rolled my eye's. "Kate you shouldn't make bets..." "I know but I can't help it." We went inside. (Kate)"Hello!?" "This place is well kept for no one living here... We walked around. We got to a room it had no windows and... A coffin. (Kate)" Is that a coffin?" I nodded. The coffin was black but it looked fancy. Before I knew it Kate opened the coffin a man was inside he looked young and beautiful... But he had pale skin and his clothes lookes old fashioned. I blinked he was gone... (Alexis)"Kate we should go..." I turned around the man was standing their. "And why would two beautiful lady's leave so soon?" (Kate)"We didn't know someone lives here." "You obviously know what I am but your not afraid?" We shook our head's. (Kate)"Where use to it." (Alexis)"Where sorry for intruding." "Not at all it's been age's since I've had company. Would you like tea?" (Kate)"I am parched." The man lead us to a beautiful room. "My name's Sebastian what's yours?" (Kate)"My name's Kate and this is Alexis." We talked for a bit. (Sebastian)"So you lost a bet?" Kate nodded. Sebastian laughed.
