Hey Rose How long are you going to nap? My tail flicked back and forth than curled up around me as I turned over. "Come on Rose their's someone at the village..." "Who?" She shrugged. "You'll have to come and see." I got up and streched. She took my paw's and ran back to the village. Everyone was gathered in the center of our village. (Rose)"What's going on?" "Someone's here giving supplies and food." "Everyone please their's enough to go around." I sniffed the air something smelled really good. The man held out his hand with some food. "Are you hungry?" My ear's perked up. I quickly snached it and ran off. "Rose wait where are you going!?" I ran to a temple that's been abandond I like to read so I come here most of the time... I ate a peace of the food that man gave me while I read. "Rose! I know your here." My friend came to where I was with more food. (Rose)"Wait howed you get here by yourself?" "Well actuly." "We helped her." I looked over. "Sorry Rose they said theyed help me if I showed them. I hope your not mad." I shook my head. (Rose)"Thank you Kate's my only friend here and it's pretty dangerouse to get here." "Master is this an intact archive?" "Look's that way." I shrugged than got up to put the books back. "Do you both study here?" (Kate)"Yup and Rose even made really cool lightsaber's...though mine arent so good yet.
