Hey Alexis did you see that new shop in town?" (Alexis)"Witch one?" "It's a magic shop they sell real magic item's. After school you should come with me." (Alexis)"Sure but is it really a good idea?" "Aren't you into that? You are gifted." (Alexis)"Just cause I can see thing's doesn't mean I'm gifted..." "Than meet up at the gate's after school." (Alexis)"Okay." School was boring the same thing every day... After school kate and I hooked up at the gate. (Kate)"Ready?" (Alexis)"Yup let's go." We headed off in the edge of town.We came to an old cottage. I looked around strangely no monster's where around... We entered. (Kate)"Hello anyone here?" "Welcome. What can I do for you lady's?" (Kate)"I heard you sell magic item's." "Yes that's right from relic's book's and herb's as well. Is their something specific your looking?" (Kate)"Kinda it's more for my friend here...Do you have a dragon stone?" "Oh that's rare and hard to come by." This place is amazing! My eye's lit up from excitement. (Kate)"I was really hoping to find one..." "Hello." "Welcome back Alexander what will it be today?" (Alexander)"The same." "Right away." (Kate)"Alexis?" (Alexis)"Did you they have the thing your looking for?" (Kate)"Nope sorry for dragging you here..." I smiled. (Alexis)"It's not that bad actual." (Kate)"Really but what about your sensativity?" I shrugged. (Alexander)"This shop is protected sinse it sells magic. You lady's came here not knowing?" "It's their first time. Here's your order. And miss I'm sorry to say but we don't have dragon's stone's here at the moment." I glared at Kate. She chuckled nervously.
