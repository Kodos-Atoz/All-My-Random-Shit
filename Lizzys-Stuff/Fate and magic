Hey Alexis did you see that new shop in town?" (Alexis)"Witch one?" "It's a magic shop they sell real magic item's. After school you should come with me." (Alexis)"Sure but is it really a good idea?" "Aren't you into that? You are gifted." (Alexis)"Just cause I can see thing's doesn't mean I'm gifted..." "Than meet up at the gate's after school." (Alexis)"Okay." School was boring the same thing every day... After school kate and I hooked up at the gate. (Kate)"Ready?" (Alexis)"Yup let's go." We headed off in the edge of town.We came to an old cottage. I looked around strangely no monster's where around... We entered. (Kate)"Hello anyone here?" "Welcome. What can I do for you lady's?" (Kate)"I heard you sell magic item's." "Yes that's right from relic's book's and herb's as well. Is their something specific your looking?" (Kate)"Kinda it's more for my friend here...Do you have a dragon stone?" "Oh that's rare and hard to come by." This place is amazing! My eye's lit up from excitement. (Kate)"I was really hoping to find one..." "Hello." "Welcome back Alexander what will it be today?" (Alexander)"The same." "Right away." (Kate)"Alexis?" (Alexis)"Did you they have the thing your looking for?" (Kate)"Nope sorry for dragging you here..." I smiled. (Alexis)"It's not that bad actual." (Kate)"Really but what about your sensativity?" I shrugged. (Alexander)"This shop is protected sinse it sells magic. You lady's came here not knowing?" "It's their first time. Here's your order. And miss I'm sorry to say but we don't have dragon's stone's here at the moment." I glared at Kate. She chuckled nervously. (Alexander)"Dragon stone's? You mean these?" He pulled stone's out of thin air they looked like jewels with dragon eye's. (Alexis)"Let's go." (Kate)"What but aren't those what you need?" I shook my head. (Alexis)"That one is far from my grasp." (Alexander)"Their are other stone's other than these infact a friend of mine collect them." "It's true their's many kind's but they don't come from this relm." (Alexander)"Right if you want to make a deal I can take you to find it but than again..." (Alexis)"What's the catch?" (Alexander)"You see my friend and I have been looking for apreantices though it's hard to find one suiting these day's I'll take on your friend though you'll have to meet mine and see if he wants you. It's up to you though." (Kate)"I'll do it." (Alexis)"Kate!" (Kate)"What we both don't have anything going for us here plus didn't you say you needed that stone?" I sighed. (Alexis)"Fine... But only to meet this friend of yours first." "You may stay here while you wait." (Alexander)"Thanks." "This way." He lead us to a room in the back. We sat down drinking some tea. We waited but not for long a man with white long silver hair he wore some kind of robes it was breath taking... "Alex I got your messege." (Alexander)"Their searching for dragon stone's so I made them in offer." (Kate)"Please. It's for Alexis." "Dragon stone's are a dragon's treasure it's rare to have one. It's their soul." (Kate)"Huh?
