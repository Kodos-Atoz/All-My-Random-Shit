Getting from my grandfather so suddenly was a little worrisome... I know he moved to an inland in the middle of no where though people still come and go... "Ma'am where about to land." "Okay thanks." Before we landed I read grandfather's letter over again. Dear Alexis I know I haven't been around for you but incase something happened I'm sending this letter with an address if you ever find yourself in danger go here their you'll find an old friend that can protect you... Wander what he means...First I should find a place to stay... We landed in the dock's. "Injoy your stay." I smiled. I got off the ship and asked around for an inn.
