This battle never ends... "Haha well what did you expect? Besides this is just practice. We won't become knights so easy. Why did you join?" I helped him up. "I joined so my brother wouldn't have to... Why did you join Alexis?" "Didn't you know? The dragon princess was asked to help train the Knight's." I glared at Mike. (Alexis)"Don't call me that geeze... And they didn't ask... I had no choice..." "Hey stop chatting and get back to practice!" "Yes sir!" We went back to practice... After hour's of practice we all cooled off the rain that just started coming down. "Hey do you thik we'll win this war?" I looked at him. (Alexis)"Unlikely unless they change their strategy... The opposing king has a master strategists and the well trained black Knight's... But let me warn you don't ask anyone else on the matter got it?"He nodded.
