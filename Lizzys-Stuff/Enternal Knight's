This battle never ends... "Haha well what did you expect? Besides this is just practice. We won't become knights so easy. Why did you join?" I helped him up. "I joined so my brother wouldn't have to... Why did you join Alexis?" "Didn't you know? The dragon princess was asked to help train the Knight's." I glared at Mike. (Alexis)"Don't call me that geeze... And they didn't ask... I had no choice..." "Hey stop chatting and get back to practice!" "Yes sir!" We went back to practice... After hour's of practice we all cooled off the rain that just started coming down. "Hey do you thik we'll win this war?" I looked at him. (Alexis)"Unlikely unless they change their strategy... The opposing king has a master strategists and the well trained black Knight's... But let me warn you don't ask anyone else on the matter got it?"He nodded. I went to lay down under a tree on our break. I had dream when I was little my father and I lived in a small hut on a farm one day they imprisoned him for being a traitor until this day he's still locked up... I opened my eye's and sighed. Remembering the past... My father is the best even if he was with the other kingdom... "Alexis!" (Alexis)"What?" "Hurry you're being summoned to the capital!" "Understood." After riding two day's to the capital we've arrived... I went straight to the king and got new order's. (King)"Alexis you are hearby stationed to the forefront of the stronghold baheamoth!" But that's the front line's... I see... (Alexis)"Yes my Lord. May I see I say goodbye to my father before I leave?" "You brat how dare." (King)"Enough! You may spend you're last day here with him. Dismissed." I bowed and left... I headed towards the prison where father was being held. The guards where knew... Actually... Never mind. (Alexis)"I've come to see my father." They let me through. "Alexis? Is that you?" I replied. (Alexis)"Yes." "What are you doing here?" (Alexis)"I came to see you one last time..." His eye's where sad. Father is a strong man who didn't let anything get to to him...well almost nothing. "Their sending me to the front line's... I suppose it was only a matter of time." I smiled. "As long as I do what they tell me you'll be fine..." "Alexis listen to me! Do you trust me?" I nodded. "Of coarse I will always trust you." "Listen well. Theirs a man their a friend tell him you're daughter he'll help you alright?" "Yes dad..." "I know you're strong and skilled use that to survive promise me." "I promise." "Time to depart." "Right. Good bye father." I kissed his hand and left. "General are you sure about this? Their sending your daughter to her death!" "That maybe their enttention but she's stronger and smarter than them and I'm sure she already knows that. She had that look in her eye's...its the same as his when they know they'll win. Besides she left me a gift." "Alexis!" Out of no where came kate hugging me along with the other Knight's in training. (Alexis)"What are you doing here?" "Didn't they tell you? where in your squad. (Alexis)"No they didn't... Well you are the best but you do know where we are heading right?" They nodded. "We know... And we also know dangerous it is but we go where you go!" "Right right now get on the ship or they'll leave without us." "Yes!" Everyone boarded.

(Alexis)"Keep up your form! A little wave shouldn't knock you off balance!" "Hey isn't that you know who?" "Ya I heard she's strict..." "Shh keep it down." (Alexis)"Come on keep it up! What would you do if your body's gave out?" "We would be dead!" "Right. Now keep swinging that sword. Kate stay focus on your spell's remember your comrads are trusting you for support!" "Yes!" "Mike your aim is all over the place!" "I can't help it this ship is unsteady..." I sighed holding out my hand to the side I chanted a spell and fired a blast dispersing the wave's. Everyone was shocked except my team. (Mike)"Show off..." I shrugged. "What do you say guy's can't let our captain out class us!?" "Right!" I chuckled. That got them motivated. A couple day's passed and we finally arrived at the pass near the fortress... When we got their. I greeted the general of the fortress. (Alexis)"Sir Alexis captain of the dragon platoon! Where here by the order of the king!" "Vary well take your team to the east tower unfortunately you'll be sharing a room." "Understood!" "Good we'll assign your posts tomorrow. Dismissed." "Yes sir." I walked out of his office and informed my team. than we head to our quarter. "Looks like someone's already asleep Captain." (Alexis)" Right... Well pick a bed and just because where not asigned yet doesn't mean you can skip out on training... What's with those faces?" "Can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep..." A man sat up from bed his hair was short and black. "Do you always sleep with your sword?" He grind. "Can never be to careful around here... What's your name?" "Alexis...And what's yours?" "Aric. The name's Aric." "Looks like will be sharing this room." The man was already back to sleep. "Right let's go have a look around."  We walked out and looked around for a bit...Everyone was whispering. "Alright let's do some training." "Aww Captain..." "No but's you can take a break later."  The man came out of the room and saw us training he also noticed everyone glaring and whispering... He went to one of the knight's. (Aric)" What are you all talking about?" "Aric!" "Didn't you know that girl is the duaghter of that traitor...And yet they let her command..." "You don't say?" He walked over to me. "Can I join your practice?" I smiled. "Sure but you better be ready! Alright guy's keep it up no stopping till you get that form right. The enemy won't wait for you!"An hour passed. "Already break time." They all fell to the ground panting exept Aric. (Aric)" Hey Alexis up for a sparr?" "Sure." Everyone cleared the area Mike handed me a sword. We took our stance and waited... Than Aric dashed towards me I blocked than we clashed swords when we got close he whispered something into my ear. "You really are his duaghter." "You know my father?" He placed some distance than went after me again our movements where unreal to everyone. (Mike)"That's our princess for you." "Shh Mike she'll hear you." He shrugged. We clashed for awhile but my body started to feel slow he cuaght me off guard...He won but he held out his hand. "Good fight." "Thanks you to." I grabbed his hand and stood up he helped back to our room and sat me on the bed. Mike closed the door. "Are you alright Alexis?" "Ya I'm fine just tired..." Kate Checked on me. (Kate)"You been pushing yourself to hard again...You should take it easy." (Alexis)"Right...Aric did you know my dad?" He looked around. "Don't worry you can trust them." "Ya I know your dad. Same brutal training like his." I breathed slowly. "My dad said I'd be able to find a friend here." "He's right their." "Guy's I know you have your family's to think about so I'll ask you one more time are you sure you want to stick with me? It's not going to be easy and your lives we'll be in danger..." "What are you saying your our dragon princess we already chose to stay with you." They all agreed. (Aric)" I can train your team while you rest." I nodded as I laid back to close my eye's. They left the room. (Aric)" Your captain's something else." "Ya she's amazing even if her trainings tuff..." (Aric)"I won't go easy ether." They agreed and started back to training.
