This battle never ends... "Haha well what did you expect? Besides this is just practice. We won't become knights so easy. Why did you join?" I helped him up. "I joined so my brother wouldn't have to... Why did you join Alexis?" "Didn't you know? The dragon princess was asked to help train the Knight's." I glared at Mike. (Alexis)"Don't call me that geeze... And they didn't ask... I had no choice..." "Hey stop chatting and get back to practice!" "Yes sir!" We went back to practice... After hour's of practice we all cooled off the rain that just started coming down. "Hey do you thik we'll win this war?" I looked at him. (Alexis)"Unlikely unless they change their strategy... The opposing king has a master strategists and the well trained black Knight's... But let me warn you don't ask anyone else on the matter got it?"He nodded. I went to lay down under a tree on our break. I had dream when I was little my father and I lived in a small hut on a farm one day they imprisoned him for being a traitor until this day he's still locked up... I opened my eye's and sighed. Remembering the past... My father is the best even if he was with the other kingdom... "Alexis!" (Alexis)"What?" "Hurry you're being summoned to the capital!" "Understood." After riding two day's to the capital we've arrived... I went straight to the king and got new order's. (King)"Alexis you are hearby stationed to the forefront of the stronghold baheamoth!" But that's the front line's... I see... (Alexis)"Yes my Lord. May I see I say goodbye to my father before I leave?" "You brat how dare." (King)"Enough! You may spend you're last day here with him. Dismissed." I bowed and left... I headed towards the prison where father was being held. The guards where knew... Actually... Never mind. (Alexis)"I've come to see my father." They let me through. "Alexis? Is that you?" I replied. (Alexis)"Yes." "What are you doing here?" (Alexis)"I came to see you one last time..." His eye's where sad. Father is a strong man who didn't let anything get to to him...well almost nothing. "Their sending me to the front line's... I suppose it was only a matter of time." I smiled. "As long as I do what they tell me you'll be fine..." "Alexis listen to me! Do you trust me?" I nodded. "Of coarse I will always trust you." "Listen well. Theirs a man their a friend tell him you're daughter he'll help you alright?" "Yes dad..." "I know you're strong and skilled use that to survive promise me." "I promise." "Time to depart." "Right. Good bye father." I kissed his hand and left. "General are you sure about this? Their sending your daughter to her death!" "That maybe their enttention but she's stronger and smarter than them and I'm sure she already knows that. She had that look in her eye's...its the same as his when they know they'll win. Besides she left me a gift." "Alexis!" Out of no where came kate hugging me along with the other Knight's in training. (Alexis)"What are you doing here?" "Didn't they tell you? where in your squad. (Alexis)"No they didn't... Well you are the best but you do know where we are heading right?" They nodded. "We know... And we also know dangerous it is but we go where you go!" "Right right now get on the ship or they'll leave without us." "Yes!" Everyone boarded.
