Alarm's sounded as guards rushed to close off the bolted door's. (Gaurd)" Hurry close that door before it's breached!" (Lex luther)"To late I would say." Lex shot off a couple of missles and wiped out anyone in his path. Circe came up from behind. (Circe)" I feel light magic underneath us..." (Sentinal's)"Stop you must not go any furthure." Circe laughed Lex and Circe both attacked them. They made their way to a sealed door Lex blew it opened. (Circe)" What do we have here? Four seal's..." (Lex)"Who is that?" (Circe)"Well if we break those seal's we'd find out wouldn't we?" (Lex)"Get to work." (Superman)" Lex I should of known you where behind this attack." (Doctor strange)"Superman they mustn't wake that girl." (Superman)"Who is she?" (Doctore strange)"She's a dragon from this earth's dark deminsion." While they where talking Lex released a net made of kryptanite witch weakend Superman. Circe broke the seals. The tank bubbled as I slowly opened my eye's I saw them. (Circe)"Time to wake up." "Who are you?" (Circe)"The one's who freed you from your sleep." "Than what is it you want?" (Lex)"Keep them from following us." "Okay." The tube shattered wing's spread from my back horn's and tail grew. I held out a hand towards the man in...strange clothes. A black magic circle appeared I chanted massive energy blasted away everything infront of me. "Oh you lived? I must still be waking up..." (Superman)" Tell me you know how to stop her?" (Doctor strange)"As long as she doesn't eat we might be able to take her out..." "And if she does?" "I'm hungery...Those beast are made of magic yes?" (Circe)" Of coarse." "Than you don't mind if I have a snack would you?" "Go ahead." I grabbed a beast with my claw it stunk but I can't be picky... I started to feed off it's magic energy the beast vanished. I lonched after the men picking up them into mid air. One got away but I was locked into a fight with the one in blue. Superman kept getting weaker the longer we fought.
