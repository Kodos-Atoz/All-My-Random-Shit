My sister and I are traveling to an old castle.(Hey sis how much further?)"Your the one who told me about it besides it's just across bridge."(Next time im riding on your back...Why can't we just fly the rest of the way?)I laughed. "Because we can't risck it spiecly if this castle has an owner once we get their than you can change back okay." My sister picked up speed. I gripped her mane tightly.
(Alexis you better hold on tight! Where almost their i can see it!)"Rose slow down! We crossed the bridge you can now!" Rose stopped. I got down off of her back and waited for her to change back to human I chuckled and gave her clothes. She blushed while putting her clothes on. Our dad was a dragon and our mother was a shape shifter. Rose has been helping me find castles while the run from a vary crazy dragon.(Rose)"Sis come on its going to storm and I know you don't like storm's." I nodded as we headed to these massive door's I looked at Rose she was younger than I but she had our mother's eye's. I knocked on the massive doors I was about to knock again when the door's opened there stood a man with old fashion clothes dark black hair and blue eye's Rose couldn't stop staring though I couldn't blame her he looked really hot. " Can I help you?" I cleared my throat.(Alexis)"Yes my sister and I where here searching for castles and came upon this one are you you its owner?"Rose elbowed me."Im just visiting but my friend inside is why don't you two come inside." His voise was just as sexy as he looked but something about him seemed off. We fallowed the man inside this place is amazing! Rose giggled. Wander where hes taking us? Rose shrugged. "This way." He led us to a nice low lit room with full of books my eye's widened. "Alexander I brought these young ladys here." A man was sitting in a nice looking chair reading he closed and got up when he turned around he was tall and breath taking he had long black hair with a gote his eyes where sharp and wise.(Alexander)"What brings...?"(Alexis)"Alexis and this is my sister Rose. Where here searching for surton castles and learn from them well Rose likes to learn while I scecht them..." I blushed when I mentioned that I sketch. Alexander smiled.(Rose)"We where wandering if we could sketch your castle and possibly explore it?"(Alexis)"Rose!"(Rose)"What?!" Alexander and his friend laughed.(Alexander)"I don't mind how about you Damian?"(Damian)"I don't mind though do you ladys have a place to stay?" We looked at each other and shook our heads. (Alexis)"We usely sleep in deserted castles we could find somewhere before the storm hits..."As I said that lightning struck I jumped. Rose covered her face.(Rose)"You had to say it." (Alexander)"Why don't you stay here we have plenty of room's it would be safer and you can stay as long as you like."I nodded.(Rose)"Yes! Wait is it haunted?"Alexander looked at us. "Last castle was..." I nudged Rose and shook my head than another lightning struck I whimpered under my breath.(Alexander)"Why don't you two get warmed up while Damian and I find you a room."We nodded. While the two left Rose and I curled up next to a really beautiful fireplace it was made of dark wood. (Sis what are we gonna do I want to stay and explore as much as I can...) (Will see I won't let anything interfere not this time I promise.)I held Rose close to keep her warm. Alexander and Damian came back Rose was asleep Damian grind while I tried to pick her up. Damian walked over and picked her up like she was a feather. Show off...Alexander showed me where we would stay it was a beautiful room it was draped in silk and wood. I yawned than cringed forgetting I was still sore. Damian laid Rose in the bed and covered her up.(Alexis)"Thank you for letting us stay." My voice was a bit pained but they smiled.(Alexander)"If you need anything we'll be in the library but in the mornings where asleep."I nodded. Looks like im not the only night time person. They bowed and left the room I sighed in relief I carefully took off my shirt I cringed at the claw marks every where I took my pants off my tail uncurled I looked into a mirror I broked down and fell on my knees covering my mouth as I cried. Alexander's eye's flashed red.
(Damian)"Thats not like you to lose your temper."Alexander rubbed his temples as his eye's went to a silver blue.(Alexander)"Forgive old friend I can't help but feel this way..."Damian placed his hand on his friends shoulder.(Damian)"I feel the same will protect them from the shadow's least their safe here."(Alexander)"Your right." Morning came and I was awake sketching the sunrise through the window Rose woke up tossing over.(Rose)"Your up early." I smiled.(Alexis)"I thought I'd sketch this view besides I couldn't sleep..." Rose got up and hugged me carefully I smiled as the storm rages on.(Rose)"Maybe a good bath will help sis." I knew she was right
