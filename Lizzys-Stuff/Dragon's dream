My sister and I are traveling to an old castle.(Hey sis how much further?)"Your the one who told me about it besides it's just across bridge."(Next time im riding on your back...Why can't we just fly the rest of the way?)I laughed. "Because we can't risck it spiecly if this castle has an owner once we get their than you can change back okay." My sister picked up speed. I gripped her mane tightly.
