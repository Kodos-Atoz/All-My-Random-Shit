My sister and I are traveling to an old castle.(Hey sis how much further?)"Your the one who told me about it besides it's just across bridge."(Next time im riding on your back...Why can't we just fly the rest of the way?)I laughed. "Because we can't risck it spiecly if this castle has an owner once we get their than you can change back okay." My sister picked up speed. I gripped her mane tightly.
(Alexis you better hold on tight! Where almost their i can see it!)"Rose slow down! We crossed the bridge you can now!" Rose stopped. I got down off of her back and waited for her to change back to human I chuckled and gave her clothes. She blushed while putting her clothes on. Our dad was a dragon and our mother was a shape shifter. Rose has been helping me find castles while the run from a vary crazy dragon.(Rose)"Sis come on its going to storm and I know you don't like storm's." I nodded as we headed to these massive door's I looked at Rose she was younger than I but she had our mother's eye's. I knocked on the massive doors I was about to knock again when the door's opened there stood a man with old fashion clothes dark black hair and blue eye's Rose couldn't stop staring though I couldn't blame her he looked really hot. " Can I help you?" I cleared my throat.(Alexis)"Yes my sister and I where here searching for castles and came upon this one are you you its owner?"Rose elbowed me."Im just visiting but my friend inside is why don't you two come inside." His voise was just as sexy as he looked but something about him seemed off. We fallowed the man inside
