I sighed but started to dance i could feel someone staring you would think my tail was out or something at least i hope not. Cassidy finnaly came back. She took my hand and handed a drink she brought me to a table with two guy's. (Cassidy)"Come on they wanted to meet and chill."

I tried to reasure that i would be fine but she smiled and away i got up and exscused myself. I left on my bike in a hurry and met up with my squad my job was dangerous and ever since Cassidy lost her brother she's been looking out for me.(Alexis)"Whats the status?" "A bomb went off at a hospital they need you on rescue and the rest put out those fires! Alexis let put this on you before ypu change it wont completly protect you but should help." I nodded and stripped almost naked while my commander rubbed some looked like lotion he traced an old scar on my back. "good to go be catefull." I nodded and changed into a wolf my coat was white as snow i took off to find anyone who needed help after putting on a harness first that way no one gets scared the sprinklers kicked in while i was tracking more people. Last ones whete kids stuck in a room i managed to get to the room through a vent but boy was it hot a nurse was trying to keep the kids calm but i could tell they whete really frightened so i nuzzled them and let them touch my fur letting them know it would be alright i heard my commander saying the floor was blocked i had to find a way to get these kids out safely i looked around when i saw the window that gave me an idea i just got to break it.i stood up and walked over to the window i pawed at it till i got the nurses attention. "What is it girl?" "I think she has a plan miss nurse." I nodded i pushed the kids to hide while i through my body ahaisnt the window it really hurt but i had to keep it up i could hear the kids chearing while the nurse kept their heads down. on break. I heard it crack one more push. With all my strength i slammed into it with all my might the glass shattered i yelped from shard fragments i looked below and rescue was ready down below the kids where still scared the nurse picked one up and told them it would be alright just think of it as a ride a bounce house one by one i nudged them to window. They all jumped the nurse was last one before she could help me i heard the door crack from the flames preasure so without second thought i pushed her out of the window i watched her get to safety but i had no strength left i laid on the floor exhausted.(Alexis you mustn't give up) but im so tired...(But you promised you would take care of Cassidy and my brother didn't you?)I chuckled my vision was starting to fade in the distance i heard voices one was my commamders voice. I looked he was carrying me to a van."Easy here drink some water
