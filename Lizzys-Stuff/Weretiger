Please stop this place is creepy... The man yanked on the chain that connected to my collar... We arrived at a huge gate beyond it was statues of gargoyles and wolves...at the end was a large mansion he yanked again as we got closer I felt as if we where being watched he banged on the large wooden doors no one answered. He was about to barge in when the doors opened a little girl answered. "Yes?" "Where's the owner of this place?" "He's around..." "Move!" "Master I don't think that's a good idea..." He yanked my chain really hard I fell in front of him. "Lilith let them in." A man was standing on top of the stairs. The girl ran to the man. He was tall and well built I stood up my hair was long and silver. My master pulled my chain towards him he whispered into my ear my eyes changed than he kissed me and released the chains. I ran towards the two and leaped onto the stairs. "Heh she'll rip you to shreds... Alexis what are you waiting for?" "She can't hear you. It's a shame to leave such a creature in you're filthy hands." Someone attacked the man but I got in the way. "In the end she'll protect me even if she has no choice... Now show them your true form!" I started to change I grew tail and ears my eyes slit with blue flames I was a huge white tiger with blue flames surrounding my body I roared and attacked the man
